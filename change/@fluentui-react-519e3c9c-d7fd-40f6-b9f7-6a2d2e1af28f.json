  "comment": "DetailsList has been modified to no longer allow \"getKey\" and \"selection\" props to be passed simultaneously. The \"getKey\" property is never used if a Selection object is passed. Either the \"getKey\" prop from the Selection object is used, or Selection's default getKey implementation (item) => item.key is used, but never the \"getKey\" prop passed to DetailsList. Making \"getKey\" and \"selection\" mutually exclusive DetailsList properties prevents users from making this mistake.",
