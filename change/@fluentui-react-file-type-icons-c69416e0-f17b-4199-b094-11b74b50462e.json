Here's the corresponding patch notes from the CDN: - New icontype 'loop' to align to the brand (keeping 'fluid' around since it's still referenced). - Renaming the KFM folders (currently un-referenced) so their names are correct. - Cleanup of video, stream, audio icons to align to one brand. - Replacing the icon-generation pipeline from Adobe Illustrator to Figma. - Adding 20x1.5 and 64 sized icons that were previously missing (thanks to new Figma workflow!)",
