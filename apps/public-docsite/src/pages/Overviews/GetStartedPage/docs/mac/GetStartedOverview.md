Fluent UI Apple is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple), native library used by Microsoft 365 apps. We offer customizations and custom controls that deliver unique Fluent experiences to customers using macOS devices.

### Controls

Fluent UI macOS includes an expanding library of controls written in Swift and supporting Objective-C. These controls implement the Fluent Design language and provide consistency across Microsoft experiences.

Documentation for the controls is a work in progress. Some controls can be found in the <a href="#/controls/mac">Controls section</a> of this site. To view the full list, see the [Fluent UI Apple GitHub source folder](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple/tree/master/macos/FluentUI).

### Start developing

Setup instructions and more information can be found in the [Fluent UI Apple readme](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-apple/blob/main/README.md).
