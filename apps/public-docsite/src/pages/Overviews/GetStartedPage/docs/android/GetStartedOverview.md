Fluent UI Android is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-android), native library used by Microsoft 365 apps. We offer customizations and custom controls that deliver unique Fluent experiences to customers using Android devices.

### Controls

Fluent UI Android includes an expanding library of controls written in Kotlin. These controls implement the Fluent design language and bring consistency across Microsoft app experiences.

Documentation for the controls is a work in progress. Some controls can be found in the <a href="#/controls/android">Controls section</a> of this site. To view the full list, see [Fluent UI Android source folder](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-android/blob/master/FluentUI/src/main/java/com/microsoft/fluentui).

### Start developing

Setup instructions and more information can be found in [Fluent UI Android readme](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-android#readme).
