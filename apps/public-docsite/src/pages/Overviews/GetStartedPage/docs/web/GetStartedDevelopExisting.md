Getting started developing with Fluent UI React is simple!

To quickly try out Fluent UI React, you can use our "Hello World" templates on [CodePen](https://aka.ms/fluentpen) or [CodeSandbox](https://aka.ms/fluentsandbox).

You can also add Fluent UI React to an existing project or use one of our starter kits to create a new project.

### Add to existing project

Fluent UI React is available via the `@fluentui/react` [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fluentui/react). To use this package in an existing project:

```shell
# with npm
npm install @fluentui/react

# with yarn
yarn add @fluentui/react
```

```jsx
import { PrimaryButton } from '@fluentui/react';
```
