Fluent UI React Native is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native) library built using JavaScript and [React Native components](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/). If you’re creating experiences for several platforms, Fluent UI React Native components can help you get the job done faster.

### Controls

Fluent UI React Native includes an expanding library of controls written in JavaScript. These controls implement the Fluent Design language and provide consistency across Microsoft experiences.

Fluent UI React Native is still in the early stages of development, and currently only supports Windows and macOS components, with iOS and Android component support coming soon. Documentation for the controls is a work in progress. Some controls can be found in the <a href="#/controls/cross">Controls section</a> of the site. To view the full list, see the [Fluent UI React Native Github source folder](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native/tree/master/packages/components).

### Start developing

Setup instructions and more information can be found in the [Fluent UI React Native readme](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native#fluentui-react-native).
