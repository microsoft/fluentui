Looking to build a Fluent experience on Windows? There are a few technologies you could use, depending on your needs.

### WinUI 3

WinUI is a user interface layer that contains native controls and styles for building Windows apps. It embodies Fluent Design, giving each Windows app the polished feel that customers expect.

To build Fluent experiences on Windows using native frameworks, see [WinUI documentation](https://microsoft.github.io/microsoft-ui-xaml/).

### Fluent UI React Native

Fluent UI React Native is an [open-source](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native) library built with JavaScript and [React Native components](https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/). Use it to create Fluent experiences that work across Windows and across other platforms. It contains information about colors and typography, as well as custom controls and customizations.

To build Fluent experiences on Windows using cross-platform frameworks, see [Get started with cross-platform](#/get-started/crossplatform).
