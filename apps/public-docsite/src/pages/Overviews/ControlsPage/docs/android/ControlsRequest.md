First, check the [Fluent UI Android issue queue](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-android/issues) to see if your component has already been requested or is being worked on. If you don't see an existing issue for the component you're looking for, please [file an issue in the repo](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-android/issues). If we're already working on it, we'll let you know. If it's new to our list, we'll keep you posted.
