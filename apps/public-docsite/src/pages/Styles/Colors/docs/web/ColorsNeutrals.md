This palette can be used to customize your `theme.palette`. See how our default `theme.palette` maps to new Fluent colors with this [web color conversion table](https://static2.sharepointonline.com/files/fabric/fabric-website/files/fabric-neutrals-web-color-conversion.pdf).​​

In case you have a need to create a custom neutral theme palette to use in your application, you can use the [Theme Designer](https://aka.ms/themedesigner).​
