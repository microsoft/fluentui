Depth (also referred to as elevation) is used to draw focus to an experience and add a physical materiality to the app. Shallow levels are reserved for items that are closely connected to the canvas or view, such as tiles. Deeper levels create a prominent frame around the surface, drawing strong focus to self-contained experiences like dialogs.
