Fluent UI primarily uses a custom font for its iconography, released under the [Microsoft Fabric Assets License](https://aka.ms/fluentui-assets-license). As of Fluent UI React version 8, an SVG-based version of the same icon set is available under the MIT license.

**This page is about the general-use monoline icons. See the [product icons page](#/styles/web/m365-product-icons) for multi-color product icons and the [file type icons page](#/styles/web/file-type-icons) for document icons.**

### When should I use Fluent UI icons?

It is recommended to use Fluent UI icons for command bars, navigation or status indicators. If you need icons to represent Microsoft 365 apps, see the [Microsoft 365 product icons page](#/styles/web/m365-product-icons). If you are representing files or digital content, see the [file type icons page](#/styles/web/file-type-icons).
