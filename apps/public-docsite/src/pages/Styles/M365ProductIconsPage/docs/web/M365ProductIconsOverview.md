Fluent UI includes product icons that you can use to connect your experience to other Microsoft 365 endpoints. The icons come in three formats: SVG and PNG for multicolor, and the [icon font for single-color](#/styles/web/icons#available-icons). All three formats come in a variety of sizes and resolutions.
