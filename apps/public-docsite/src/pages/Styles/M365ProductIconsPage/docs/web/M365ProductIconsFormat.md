Microsoft 365 product icons look best at 16x16, 48x48, and 96x96 pixel sizes in the UI of Microsoft products. Fluent UI provides these icons in both SVG and PNG formats. SVGs are more versatile, and can be resized more easily since they are vectors, but are not supported by all browsers. PNGs are supported by most browsers, but require many sizes to remain visually crisp.

Both PNGs and SVGs are available in predefined dimensions at 16x16, 20x20, 32x32, 40x40, 48x48, 64x64 and 96x96 pixel sizes. Where possible, use the default sizes to prevent artifacts and blurry subpixel rendering for PNGs. Otherwise, use the size that most closely maps to what you need for your experience for the best quality.

Monochrome product icons that are included in the icon font are subject to the branding guidelines, but you can reference them just like other icons noted in the [icons section](#/styles/web/icons).
