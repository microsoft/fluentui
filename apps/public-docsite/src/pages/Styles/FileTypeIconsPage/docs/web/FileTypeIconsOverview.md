Fluent UI includes document icons that you can use to connect your experience to other Microsoft 365 endpoints. The icons are provided in SVG and PNG formats with a variety of sizes and resolutions.

File type icons represent user content, typically "files" in the classical sense, but also many "digital objects" like SharePoint pages or Sway stories. These icons are usually bigger and more detailed than command icons, and they're replaced with an actual thumbnail preview when possible.

Usage of these icons is subject to the [assets license agreement (PDF)](https://aka.ms/fluentui-assets-license). Please read this document and the resolution/size guidance carefully to ensure that you use our product icons correctly to create the best experience.
