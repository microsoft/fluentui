With a Link, users can navigate to an external URL, or be overridden to perform a custom action. A link can be set to have an underline when the mouse hovers over it, or remove the underline completely to reduce visual clutter.

A Link is the lightest weight clickable control, and is often used to reduce the visual complexity of a design.
