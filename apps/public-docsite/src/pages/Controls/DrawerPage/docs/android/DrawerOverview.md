`Drawer` and `DrawerDialog` let you reveal lightweight views inside your application without being a full-screen view that takes over the navigation hierarchy. They are easy to dismiss as well as resize, and may leave space on-screen that shows the content behind them. `Drawer` retains state on configuration change.
