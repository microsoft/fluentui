# Patches for TS minbar test

Some partners might be on incompatible versions of typescript, but are willing to patch incompatible
types on their end. If this is the case, simply create a similar patch for the affected code with
[patch-package](https://github.com/ds300/patch-package) and drop the resulting patch in this folder.
