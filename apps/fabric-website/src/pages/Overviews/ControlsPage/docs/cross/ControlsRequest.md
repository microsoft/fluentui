First, check the [Fluent UI React Native Windows issue queue](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native/issues) to see if your component has already been requested or is being worked on. If you don't see an existing issue for the component you're looking for, please [file an issue in the repo](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-react-native/issues), and we'll respond about whether it's being built or on our radar.
