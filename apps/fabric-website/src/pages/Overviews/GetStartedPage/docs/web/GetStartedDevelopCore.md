### Fabric Core

[Fabric Core](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-core) is a collection of CSS classes and Sass mixins that give you access to Fabric's colors, animations, fonts, icons and grid.

### Adding Fabric Core to your site

To add Fabric Core to your site, link to this CSS file in the `<head>` of your webpage:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://static2.sharepointonline.com/files/fabric/office-ui-fabric-core/9.6.1/css/fabric.min.css" />
```

You can also download a copy of Fabric for your project or add it through a package manager. You can also build your own copy from the source code.

Add the ms-Fabric class to a containing element, such as `<body>`, to set the font-family for all Fabric typography classes used within that element. Then apply the Fabric styles directly to your HTML elements.

```html
<body class="ms-Fabric" dir="ltr">
  <span class="ms-font-su ms-fontColor-themePrimary">Big blue text</span>
</body>
```
