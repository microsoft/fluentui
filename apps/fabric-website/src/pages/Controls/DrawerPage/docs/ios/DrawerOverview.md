Drawers let you reveal lightweight views inside your application without being a full-screen view that takes over the navigation hierarchy. They are easy to dismiss & resize, and may leave space on-screen that shows the content behind them.

<!-- Drawers and action sheets are similar, revealing themselves from the bottom or the top of the screen, usually revealing a simpler set of commands or options. -->
