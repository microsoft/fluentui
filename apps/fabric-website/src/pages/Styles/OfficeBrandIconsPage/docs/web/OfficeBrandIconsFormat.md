Multicolor product and document icons look best at 16x16, 48x48, and 96x96 px sizes in the UI of Microsoft products. Fabric provides these icons in both SVG and PNG formats. SVGs are more versatile but are not supported by all browsers. PNGs are supported by most browsers, but require many sizes to remain visually crisp.

PNGs come in 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, and 96x96 pixel sizes. Where possible, use the default sizes to prevent artifacts and split pixels. Otherwise, use a size that is close to one of the default sizes.

Because SVGs are vectors, you can resize them more easily. They come in two sizes: 16x16 and 48x48 px. Use the size that most closely maps to what you need for your experience for the best quality.

Monochrome product icons that are included in the icon font are subject to the branding guidelines, but you can reference them just like other icons noted in the [icons section](#/styles/web/icons).
