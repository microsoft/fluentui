# @fluentui/react-18-tests-v8

**Tests for React 18 compatibility in [Fluent UI React v8](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web)**.

## Usage

### `start`

```shell
# yarn start
```

This app has a simple CRA style `App.tsx` file to allow testing and triaging Fluent UI v8 components in a React 18 environment. Please do not commit any new content to this file that isn't useful for everyone else.

This file and process will be replaced with Storybook once we are able to get storybook working in React 18 in our mono-repo.

### `test`

```shell
# yarn test
```

Add test files for React 18 issues that have been triaged and resolved so that we do not regress.
