# Internal stories for SSR tests

This project is not configured to host a storybook but contains
storyfiles. The storyfiles in this folder are used for test cases that we do
not want on the public docsite.

The project does not actually need to host a storybook, but the storybook
setup is still applied for consistency with other projects.
