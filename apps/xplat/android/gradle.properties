# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the Gradle Daemon. The setting is
# particularly useful for configuring JVM memory settings for build performance.
# This does not affect the JVM settings for the Gradle client VM.
# The default is `-Xmx512m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=256m`.

# When configured, Gradle will fork up to org.gradle.workers.max JVMs to execute
# projects in parallel. To learn more about parallel task execution, see the
# section on Gradle build performance:

# Default is `false`.
