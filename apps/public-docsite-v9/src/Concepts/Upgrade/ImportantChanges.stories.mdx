# Important changes you should know about

v9 introduces several paradigm shifts that were necessary to improve performance, ease development, and reduce bundle size.
This resulted in some breaking changes you will need to handle as you upgrade.

## Props vs. Children

### v8

In v8, several components had props that accepted arrays of data and used a map function to render the children.
To allow control over rendering individual items, render props callbacks were added.

Components that rendered large lists of items had lots of specific behavior (such as virtualization) hard coded within the component.

For example, `ContextualMenuButton` takes `menuProps` containing menu data,
an optional `menuAs` to control the rendering of menu items,
and an optional `onMenuClick`.

```tsx
const menuProps: IContextualMenuProps = {
  items: [
    {
      key: 'emailMessage',
      text: 'Email message',
    },
    {
      key: 'calendarEvent',
      text: 'Calendar event',
    },
  ],
  directionalHintFixed: true,
};

function _getMenu(props: IContextualMenuProps): JSX.Element {
  return <ContextualMenu {...props} />;
}

function _onMenuClick(ev?: React.SyntheticEvent<any>) {
  console.log(ev);
}

<DefaultButton text="New item" menuProps={menuProps} menuAs={_getMenu} onMenuClick={_onMenuClick} />;
```

### v0

For v0, array props are also not used. Render props callback works very similarly in v9 as it was in v0.

### v9

Components in v9 give you full control of rendering items by allowing you to pass child elements instead of data props.
This allows you to define and compose children however you like: declaring JSX elements or writing your own map function.
You don't have to define and pass separate renderprops functions to control the rendering of children.

This means that your existing code passing arrays of data will need to be updated to render child elements.

In v9, you get much more control over menus including what component triggers the display of the menu or submenu.
By specifying the children you directly control the rendering of each child and can wire up onClick handlers directly
rather than having to figure out which menuItem was clicked.

```tsx
<Menu>
  <MenuTrigger>
    <Button>New Item</Button>
  </MenuTrigger>
  <MenuPopover>
    <MenuList>
      <MenuItem onClick={onNewEmailMessage}>Email message</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem onClick={onNewCalendarEvent}>Calendar event</MenuItem>
    </MenuList>
  </MenuPopover>
</Menu>
```

You can continue to leverage existing data structures by writing a map function.
With the map function separate from the Menu component, you get a lot more control.

```tsx
<Menu>
  <MenuTrigger>
    <Button>
      New Item
    </Button>
  </MenuTrigger>
  <MenuPopover>
    <MenuList>
      {menuItems.map(item => <MenuItem onClick={item.onClick}>{item.name}</MenuItem>)
    </MenuList>
  </MenuPopover>
</Menu>
```

## Custom Styling & Theming

There are significant styling and theming differences between v8 and v9.

### v8

In v8, the `styles` prop on components accepts javascript objects (IStyle).
These could be parameterized to generate styles at runtime.
Unfortunately, this has a negative impact on rendering performance.

The ThemeProvider provided a theme object on the context.
The theme contains a collection of component styles, color palettes, fonts, and spacing values.
Components consumed the theme through the theme object in state or by using the `useTheme` hook.
Legacy themes are supported through loadTheme and the theme customizer.

For example, a `Button` can be styled to look like a primary button when hovered.

```tsx
const theme = useTheme();

const customButtonStyles: IButtonStyles = {
  rootHovered: {
    backgroundColor: theme.semanticColors.primaryButtonBackground,
    color: theme.semanticColors.primaryButtonText,
  },
};

return (
  <ThemeProvider>
    <Button styles={customButtonStyles}>Hello Custom Styles</Button>
  </ThemeProvider>
);
```

### v0

In v0, `styles` and `design` prop on components accept javascript objects. Styling and theming is also possible by using `variables` and extending the theme with custom varables.
Flexible system of design variables allowed different consumers to extend their design systems in different ways. In v9, variables API is no longer available as it was one of the reasons for frequent style calculation during runtime. Instead, there was a different approach chosen in order to improve rendering performance - style overrides or CSS variables can be used to achieve similar functionality.

Due to the high flexibility of variables, it is not possible to provide a straightforward migration plan for them. You can use the v0 debug panel to observe what styles are being applied based on variable change and transform those styles using [style transformation tool](aka.ms/perestroika).

### v9

In v9, styles are created with the `makeStyles` function and combined with the `mergeClasses` function from [`@griffel/react`](https://github.com/microsoft/griffel).
Components apply styles through the `className` property.
The styles are created at build time, but never runtime (requires the use of `griffel`'s build-time optimization plugin).
This allows styles to be deduped, optimized, and bundled for significantly smaller bundles and improved CSS performance.

There is a new theme provider in v9 named `FluentProvider` that replaces v8's `ThemeProvider`.

FluentProvider provides a theme using css variables referencing design tokens.
The design tokens provide global colors, fonts, and spacing.
There are alias tokens for general purpose component parts (e.g. background, border).
Components consume the theme, by importing `tokens`, a collection of css var usage, and using them in `makeStyles`.

FluentProvider can be nested multiple times in the hierarchy to create theme variations and `dir` changes for a scoped set of components.
FluentProvider does **not** have a default theme like ThemeProvider, so you'll need to set the theme at your application's root for the components to be styled correctly.

For example, the same `Button` customization as before would be done like this.

```tsx
const useStyles = makeStyles({
  base: {
    ':hover': {
      backgroundColor: tokens.colorBrandBackground,
      color: tokens.colorNeutralForegroundOnBrand,
    },
  },
});

const customButtonStyles = useStyles();
return <Button className={customButtonStyles.base}>Example</Button>;
```

## Component Part Customization

In v8, parts of components were customized through render props callbacks.
Part-specific callbacks were provided by individual components.
Many callbacks included data payloads to allow you to pass data per item into a callback.

In v9, part customization is done through a slots mechanism.
The props for a component can define slots that allow you to replace the entire part with JSX,
properties to pass to the default slot component style,
or a render function.

See the [Customizing Components with Slots](/docs/concepts-developer-customizing-components-with-slots--page) topic for detailed information on slots.
