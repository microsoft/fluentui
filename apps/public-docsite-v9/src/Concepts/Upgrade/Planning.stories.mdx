# Planning your journey

As mentioned before, Fluent UI React v9 was designed to allow you to incrementally upgrade.
You have a lot of flexibility on how you approach, plan, and execute moving to v9.

This part of the guide will help you assess your project, choose your approach,
and plan out an iterative cycle for a successful upgrade.

## Assessing your application

How your application uses Fluent will influence your approach.
Scan over your codebase and try to answer the following questions:

1. What Fluent components does your application use?
2. For each component, how many times is each component used (i.e. usage instances)?
3. Is most usage basic or advanced?

Basic usage means you use the component with minimal customization.
You pass typical props and bind data from your components or application state.

```tsx
<Button primary onClick={onStartUpgrade}>
  Start upgrade to version {version}
</Button>
```

Advanced usage includes things like passing complex custom styles objects, callbacks for custom rendering, using refs to make imperative calls, and complex data binding.

## Considerations

There are lots of ways to upgrade. Here are are some different options to consider.

### Incremental or All-at-once

_Incremental_: upgrade a few components and ship, often by flighting the upgraded components to a subset of users.
The benefits of the incremental approach are that you get v9 improvements sooner, find issues earlier,
and can iteratively get faster upgrading components.

Since v9 does not have all the components offered in previous versions yet, incrementally upgrading allows you to gradually introduce v9
side-by-side with v8 or v0.
You can more closely monitor the changes to bundle size and performance improvements with a gradual approach.

_All-at-once_: upgrade every v8/v0 component to their v9 equivalent.
You can still flight the upgraded experience to a subset of users.
You get the benefit that you could A/B route to different web application servers when flighting and keep the
previous untouched version running independent of the upgraded version.

You also get the maximum benefits of v9 including a new consistent style,
tree-shaking out v8 components from the bundles, build-time CSS optimizations, and render performance improvements.

### Horizontal or Vertical

_Horizontal_: upgrading one component across your entire application.
For example, upgrading Button from previous version to v9 everywhere.
This has the benefit that your code will end up only depending on v9 Button and the v8 Button won't be included in the downloaded bundle.
Your buttons will look and behave the same across your app.

_Vertical_: upgrading all the components in one part of your application.
For example, upgrading Button, Divider, Persona, and Link on a contact status side bar.
This has the benefit that you can upgrade one part of your application in isolation leaving the rest of the app unaffected.
You can choose a non-critical part of your application to reduce risk of app-wide issues.
It makes it easier to trace any issues caused by upgrade.
Vertical may allow you to find integration issues earlier as you are using multiple new components.

You can also choose to upgrade one component in one part of your application.
You lose some of the benefits of each individual approach, but can try things out more slowly.

### Deep or Shallow

_Deep_: upgrading components that are core to your application and re-used in many places.
For example, upgrading a main toolbar to use the v9 Button and Menu components.
You get the benefits of v9 across the entire application.
You will get more usage of the upgraded components and can gather feedback earlier.

_Shallow_: upgrading components that appear only in one non-critical place in your application.
For example, upgrading an optional edit profile screen.
You get the benefit of limiting risk, but decrease the usage and may not find issues right away.

### New v9 or Old v8 style

If you have v8 and v9 components side-by-side, you may want to avoid noticable style differences.
If you need style consistency, apply theming and style customizations to make v8 components look like v9 components,
or make v9 components look like v8 components.

You may decide you can live with the style differences for a period of time.
Most are small changes that are only noticable when v8 and v9 versions of the same component are next to each other in the UI.

### New v9 or Old v0 style

v0 will to some extent gradually converge its appearance. However, you might still need to use style overrides in some cases to achieve consistency.

### Manual changes, code mod scripts, or shims

_Manual_: update each usage of Fluent React by hand.
This is the brute force approach to upgrade.
It may be the best option especially for smaller projects.
You may have a lot of variety in how you use components that preclude a search/replace or automated option.
You may also have an existing wrapper around a component that allows you to upgrade at a single code location.
The benefits include you can call v9 components as intended, the opportunity to simplify and improve
how your code uses Fluent, and you can make incremental check-ins ensuring existing tests pass.

_Code mod_: author a script to update multiple locations in your code at once.
You may be able to leverage existing scripts from previous upgrades, from others who have upgraded, or from the Fluent React team.
If your codebase is very consistent in how it uses Fluent, this option can save a lot of extra effort over manual upgrade.
You can have code mods that add flighting logic around usage to have both v8/v0 and v9 available.
The downside is that if your usage is complex or highly varied, authoring a code mod that covers all cases may be impractical.

_Shims_: author or use a component that takes v8/v0 props and renders a v9 component.
Shims can be a good option to get v9 components in your app if you don't have the time to update all the places you use the component.
You can leave your props creation code alone and pass it to the shim.
It is easy to search/replace your code to update to using the shim.
You can also do your flighting logic within the shim itself.
One downside is that your shim will retain the dependency on v8/v0 and prevent removing it from your bundle.
Also, there are cases with custom renderprops callbacks that cannot be supported by a shim because the rendered
content is not compatible with the v9 component.

## Recommendations

### Small projects

If you have a small project and can commit the effort, we recommend upgrading everything and modifying the code directly.

This gives you the maximum benefit of rendering performance, build time style bundling, and tree-shaking out v8 components that are no longer used. You'll be able to refactor any advanced usage cases in the newer v9 paradigms and end up with cleaner code.

You should still consider flighting the upgraded experience, but you can A/B the entire application rather than if/then flighting per component in the code.

### Medium or larger with advanced usage

If you have a medium to large project, significant advanced usage of components, and limited resources or time constraints, we recommend leveraging the shim components.

You can replace all the usages of a component like Button with ShimButton and get a v9 Button rendered. You get the benefits of v9 components and can crawl over the code to update to use v9 directly at your leisure.

Warning! Shims aren't free. You'll still need to modify code to upgrade custom styles, renderprops callbacks, and ref usage. Shims take a dependency on the v8 types and v9 components, so tree-shaking may be limited. Shims introduce mapping logic (although it shouldn't signficantly impact render performance).

### Medium or larger apps with basic usage

If you have a large project with hundreds to thousands of Fluent component usages, we strongly recommend upgrading horizontally. The Button component is a typical choice to upgrade across the application.

If your usage is mostly basic, we recommend authoring a code-mod to handle what would be too tedious with search & replace. Consider running code-mods to handle most cases and then do some manual upgrade work to cover the rest.

### Large with advanced usage

If you have a large projects with thousands of Fluent component usages, a lot of advanced usage, and several resource constraints, we recommend creating an application-specific shim and permanent abstraction around the Fluent component.

A permanent abstraction will give you a place to adapt for compatibility as you move from v8 props to v9 props. It will also be valuable with future upgrades. v9 has a new hook-based composition model you can leverage to create a shim without introducing the extra virtual DOM elements of a wrapper. You can also introduce the flighting logic within your shim to be able to toggle the upgrade on/off.

You can consider code-mods to upgrade the more basic usage, but will likely find too much variance to handle all the cases across your code.

We recommend you upgrade horizontally, but you may want to upgrade horizontally within one portion of your application at a time. For example, all the buttons in a toolbar or on a related set of pages in your application. This lets you upgrade in stages without destabilizing then entire application.

If you have a subsystem of your application that is independent and similar to a small/medium application, you may choose to upgrade it vertically. You can have a cohesive improvement to one part of the application and flight it independent of the rest of the application.

## Creating a plan

We strongly recommend using a work item tracking system or Excel spreadsheet to plan out your upgrade tasks.

### A plan for a plan

You should create and complete a set of planning tasks:

1. Measure the current bundle size, render performance, and other metrics for later comparison.
2. Determine the mechanism for how you will flight the upgraded components to a subset of users.
3. Decide on any pre-upgrade improvements that you will make first to reduce upgrade effort.
4. Determine what other constraints you have - maximum bundle size, performance bars, allowed style inconsistencies, etc.
5. Assess the application and choose your approach.
6. Choose a target deadline or milestone date for each phase of upgrade.

### Getting started tasks

You should plan a set of getting started tasks for upgrading one component in one location.

1. Update project to reference Fluent React v9.
2. Add FluentProvider with a theme to the root of the app
3. Add any v9 component to the UI, verify it renders as expected, then remove it.
4. Update a single usage location to use the v9 component. Consider recording how long it takes.

### Iterative planning

Plan a task or set of tasks to be able to 'rinse and repeat' each usage upgrade.

- The type of tasks and their granularity will vary depending on your approach.
- After upgrading some instances, review how long each took and plan out the next set of tasks.
