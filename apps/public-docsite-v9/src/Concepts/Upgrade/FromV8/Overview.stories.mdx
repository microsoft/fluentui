# Upgrading from v8 to v9

If you or your team are currently using version 8 of `@fluentui/react` and are thinking of upgrading to version 9
then we would first like to **_thank you_** for making the jump and tell you how excited we are for you to experience all the improvements and features we have been working on.

There are several things to keep in mind when upgrading, so we have created these uprade guide topics explaining:

- the new concepts you will encounter and how they map to v8
- things to consider when planning upgrade work
- detailed guidance on upgrading components
- examples and helper code to make upgrading easier

We highly recommend reading through the v9 concepts for developers and the component documentation.
Knowing how v9 works will provide needed context for upgrading.

## Why should I upgrade from v8 to v9?

Fluent UI React v9 provides significant improvements to components over v8.

Some reasons to upgrade to v9:

- New and improved visual styling, rendering performance, and accessibility
- Easier to use and more consistent component props
- Build-time CSS-in-JS
- Component customization using slots
- Design token language with an improved theme provider
- Component composition and re-use leveraging React hooks
- Reduced bundle size with tree shaking

## Do I have to upgrade all at once?

Absolutely not! **You can upgrade incrementally**.

Fluent UI v9 was built as separate libraries with the intention of support incremental adoption of v9 components alongside v8 components.

## What if I'm on v7 right now?

We recommend first upgrading v7 to v8. The upgrade is mostly fixing a few breaking changes and replacing some deprecated components or props with newer versions.

## What is available in v9?

Version 9 is a "converged" library built from the ground-up that addresses many of the concerns and issues that plagued version 8.
However, this approach means that the intial number of version 9 components is fewer than existed in version 8.
Some components have also been renamed and a couple of them have been retired.

At the time of this writing, v9 has an initial set of components shipped as a release candidate.
There are also some components in preview that are more likely to change than the release candidate components.
However, **all published components are production ready**.

The v9 RC provides the following v8 equivalents: Avatar (previously Persona), Buttons, Divider, Image, Link, Portal and Popover (previously Layer/Overlay), Text, and Tooltip.
There are also new components: Accordion, Badges, and Menu.

See the [Component Mapping](/docs/concepts-upgrading-from-v8-component-mapping--page) for a complete list.

## How much effort is required?

We won't sugarcoat it; upgrading from v8 to v9 is more involved than the previous v7 to v8 upgrade.
There are breaking changes, component differences, and paradigm shifts.

The good news is that you can upgrade incrementally and take it one step at a time.
