## Customizing Components with Slots

Fluent UI React components have parts that are designed to be modified or replaced.
These are called slots.
Slots provide a more flexible approach over render callbacks used in previous versions of Fluent UI
and are conceptually similar to slots in other component libraries and frameworks.

- Each slot is exposed as a top-level prop of the same name.
- Some slots have default content and others are empty by default.
- Slots may target different types of elements or components to restrict the type of content.
- You can fill a slot with a primitive value, JSX/TSX, props objects, or a render function.

You can think of component slots like a template where the dotted line parts can be cut out and replaced.
For example, the `Input` component has `contentBefore` and `contentAfter` slots.

### When to use slots

Use a component's slots when you want to

- set the content of a component part
- customize the style of a component part (via `className` prop)
- customize the props passed to a component part
- subscribe to event handlers of a component part
- change the element type of a component part (via `as` prop)
- completely replace existing content of a slot

Later in this topic, you will find examples covering each of these scenarios.

### When to not use slots

- If you are trying to change the visual appearance of every instance of a component, prefer to customize the theme.
  Fluent UI React components leverage theme design tokens to render consistently.
  For example, if you want to have borders to be a specific color on `:hover`,
  you can create a theme that overrides `colorNeutralStroke1Hover`.

- If you need to slightly adjust the display of a specific component instance, prefer to apply a custom style.
  For example, if you want to make a particular component have a thicker border,
  create a class style using `makeStyles` and then apply it to the component using `className`.
  See the Styling Components topic for more information.

- If you want to change how a component behaves, make significant layout and style changes,
  replace non-slot parts, or wrap a component with different props, then consider using the hooks API.
  The hooks API gives you complete control to recompose a component but is more complex than using slots.

### Conditional rendering

Some components conditionally render slots.

For example, Avatar has a `label` slot that only renders when there is no image provided.
It also defines an `icon` slot that only renders when neither an image nor a name are provided.

### What about children?

The primary content within a component is defined by adding children.
Component children allow for building deep hierarchies using JSX/TSX.
They also allow for heterogeneous types of content.

For example, `Accordion` is a hierarchy of `AccordionItem` elements.

```tsx
<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem value="1">
    <AccordionHeader>Accordion Header 1</AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <div>Accordion Panel 1</div>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="2">
    <AccordionHeader>Accordion Header 2</AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <div>Accordion Panel 2</div>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem value="3">
    <AccordionHeader>Accordion Header 3</AccordionHeader>
    <AccordionPanel>
      <div>Accordion Panel 3</div>
    </AccordionPanel>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>
```

## Usage examples

### Passing a shorthand value

You can pass a primitive value to slots.
The `Input` component's `contentBefore` and `contentAfter` slots can be passed strings.

```tsx
<Input contentBefore="$" value="10" contentAfter=".00" />
```

You can pass JSX elements to slots.
For example, the `Button` component can be passed an `img` or an `CalendarRegular24` icon.

```tsx
<>
  <Button icon={<img src='site-icon.png' alt='branded site icon' /> }
  <Button icon={<CalendarRegular24 />} />
</>
```

Any shorthand value provided to a slot is converted to that slot's children content. In the example above, when the `icon` slot is passed an `img` JSX element, the `img` element is rendered as the `icon` slot's children:

```html
<!-- button root element -->
<button class="fui-Button">
  <!-- icon slot -->
  <span class="fui-Button__icon">
    <!-- icon slot children -->
    <img src="site-icon.png" alt="branded site icon" />
  </span>
</button>
```

### Passing slot properties object

A slot can take in the props of the type it is rendering.
When a slot renders an element, you can pass any native element props for that element type.
When a slot renders a React component, you can pass any of the components props.

The `Avatar` component has a `badge` slot that renders a `PresenceBadge`.
This allows you pass `PresenceBadge` props.

```tsx
<Avatar name="Support" badge={{ status: 'available', 'aria-label': 'available' }} />
```

You can pass the `className` prop to customize the style of a slot.
The `Avatar` badge slot supports a `className`, allowing the badge style to be customized.

```tsx
const useStyles = makeStyles({
  badge: { color: tokens.colorBrandStroke1 },
});

const BusyBrandAvatar = () => {
  const styles = useStyles();
  return <Avatar name="IT probably" badge={{ status: 'busy', className: styles.badge }} />;
};
```

You can pass the `as` prop to change the element type of a slot.
Note that you must choose from one of the available element types the slot supports.

```tsx
// here we render the AccordionHeader as h1, by default it is a div
// and internally AccordionHeader has a button slot that is a button by default,
// but in this case we are changing it to an anchor
<AccordionHeader as="h1" button={{ as: 'a' }}>
  Accordion Header as h1
</AccordionHeader>
```

```html
<h1 class="fui-AccordionHeader">
  <a class="fui-AccordionHeader__button"> Accordion Header as h1 </a>
</h1>
```

### Replacing the entire slot

When you pass content or props to a slot,
the component renders the content within a component or element based on the slot type.
If you need to replace the slot's entire content, including the containing element,
pass a render function as the children.

This is an escape hatch in the slots API, so prefer the other techniques whenever possible.
If you replace the entire slot, very accessibility, layout, and styling still work properly.

By passing `renderBigLetterIcon` as the `children`, the `span` that normally contains the icon is replaced with an `b` (bold).

```tsx
const renderBigLetterIcon (Component, props) => {
  return <b>B</b>;
};

<Button icon={{ children: renderBigLetterIcon }}>Bold</Button>;
```

## For component developers

### Slot type

In `@fluentui/react-utilities`, `compose/types.ts` defines the types for the slots API.

> This explanation of the types starts with some oversimplification then adds more detail.
> For full details, see the `compose/types.ts` file comments.

The `Slot` type allows components to define a slot.

```ts
type Slot<Type, AlternateAs>
```

`Type` defines the default element or component for the slot.
It can be a single intrinsic element type (i.e. an HTML element like 'div') or a React component type.

`AlternateAs` allows the slot to support other kinds of elements through the `as` prop.
It can be a single intrinsic element type, or a union of element types.

Currently, `AlternateAs` only supports intrinsic element types.
This is necessary to ensure components restrict slots where `Type` is a component type.
Substituting other component types has caused deep typing, accessibility, and event handler problems in the past.

| Slot                                 | Renders                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Slot<'div'>`                        | A `div` is always rendered                                                                        |
| `Slot<typeof Button>`                | A `Button` component accepting `Button` props is rendered                                         |
| `Slot<'span', 'div' `&#124;` 'pre'>` | A `span` is rendered by default. A caller can opt to render `div` or `pre` by using the `as` prop |

### Slot definition

A `Slot` can be passed a literal value, an object containing props, or a render function callback.
The `Slot` type is defined using `WithSlotShorthandValue<Props>`.

> The type definition here is simplified.
> For full details, see the `compose/types.ts` file comments.

```ts
type Slot<Type, AlternateAs> =
      ...
      WithSlotShorthandValue<
          Type extends keyof JSX.IntrinsicElements
            ? { as?: Type } & WithSlotRenderFunction<IntrisicElementProps<Type>>
            : Type extends React.ComponentType<infer Props>
            ? WithSlotRenderFunction<Props>
            : Type
        >
      ...
```

Following `WithSlotShorthandValue<Props>`, it is defined as the `Props` object
or the `children` of a React child, array of nodes, or portal.

```ts
type WithSlotShorthandValue<Props extends { children?: unknown }> =
  | Props
  | Extract<SlotShorthandValue, Props['children']>;

type SlotShorthandValue = React.ReactChild | React.ReactNodeArray | React.ReactPortal;
```

Following `WithSlotRenderFunction<Props>`, it is defined as the `Props` object and children.
The children can be JSX/TSX or a function that renders JSX/TSX.

```ts
type WithSlotRenderFunction<Props extends { children?: unknown }> = Props & {
  children?: Props['children'] | SlotRenderFunction<Props>;
};

type SlotRenderFunction<Props> = (
  Component: React.ElementType<Props>,
  props: Omit<Props, 'children' | 'as'>,
) => React.ReactNode;
```

### Defining slots in component props

In the Fluent UI React composition architecture, components define their props using `ComponentProps<Slot>`
and state for rendering using `ComponentState<Slot>`.

For example, Spinner defines optional spinner and label slots.

```tsx
type SpinnerSlots = {
  root: NonNullable<Slot<'div'>>;
  spinner?: Slot<'span'>;
  label?: Slot<typeof Label>;
};
```

#### Optional slots

Like any property, slots can be made optional by using the trailing `?`.
The component developer can decide if default content is rendered when a slot is `undefined` or
if nothing is rendered.

#### NonNullable slots

When a slot is defined in the props of a component, it can be set to null to prevent the slot from being rendered.
In cases where components need to require a slot to always be rendered,
it can be wrapped in `NonNullable<T>`.

For example, in `RadioButton` the indicator must always be rendered.

```ts
indicator: NonNullable<Slot<'div'>>;
```

Non-nullable and optional/required slots are independent from one another.
A slot can be defined with as optional or required and nullable or non-nullable.

#### The special root slot

Every component has a `root` slot.
The root slot represents the top-level element the component renders.

Properties passed to the component are generally applied to the root slot.
Some components logically wrap an intrisic element and need to provide other elements around that intrinsic element.
In this case, the component will pass properties to the slot for the intrinsic element.
The `className` and `style` props are always passed to the root slot.

For example, the `Input` component renders the `contentBefore`, `input`, and `contentAfter` within a span.
Props like `value` and 'placeholder' need to be passed to the `<input>` intrinsic element.
Slots like `input` are refered to as a primary slot.

```ts
export type InputSlots = {
  root: NonNullable<Slot<'span'>>;
  input: NonNullable<Slot<'input'>>;
  contentBefore?: Slot<'span'>;
  contentAfter?: Slot<'span'>;
};
```

### Styling components with slots

You can think of each slot as a container for props and style that will be rendered as an element.

The Fluent UI hooks architecture breaks up component rendering primarily into 3 parts

- use*Component*(): This takes in props and produces state
- use*Component*Styles() - This uses state to define and apply class styles
- render*Component*() - This renders the elements of the component

> If you see the suffix `_unstable` that means that the API may have a breaking change in the future.
> It does **not** mean the code is unstable or unfit for production.

`Button` follows this pattern:

- `useButton` will take in `ButtonProps` and return `ButtonState`.

```ts
const useButton_unstable = (
  props: ButtonProps,
  ref: React.Ref<HTMLButtonElement | HTMLAnchorElement>,
): ButtonState
```

Hooks like `useButton` calculate state from props. Typically, this involves filling in default values, adding event handlers,
and define the default element types for each slot.

- `useButtonStyles` takes in and mutates `ButtonState` adding classNames to each slot.

```ts
const useButtonStyles_unstable = (state: ButtonState)
```

Hooks like `useButtonStyles` create classes and conditionally apply them based on the input state. Classes are typically created and applied with `makeStyles` and `mergeClasses`.
For instance, if a component is disabled then disabled styles are added.

### Declaring components slots in the state

The `Button` component defines its slots `root` and `icon` in the state.

```ts
const useButton_unstable = (props: ButtonProps, ref: React.Ref<HTMLButtonElement | HTMLAnchorElement>): ButtonState => {
  return {
    root: slot.always({ ...props, ref }, { elementType: 'button' }),
    icon: slot.optional(props.icon, { elementType: 'span' }),
  };
};
```

- `slot.always` creates a slot that will always render, and as such the user may not provide `null` to opt-out of this slot (NonNullable slot).
- `slot.optional` creates a slot that can be opted out of and is not rendered by default, it only renders if `props.icon` is different from `undefined` (Optional slot).

Both `slot.always` and `slot.optional` methods will create a slot definition that can be consumed by the render method to properly render a slot, these methods ensure the local logic provided by the state hook will remain on the slots internals.

### Rendering components with slots

- `renderButton` takes in `ButtonState` and renders content.

```tsx
/** @jsxRuntime automatic */
/** @jsxImportSource @fluentui/react-jsx-runtime */

import { assertSlots } from '@fluentui/react-utilities';

const renderButton_unstable = (state: ButtonState) => {
  const { iconOnly, iconPosition } = state;

  assertSlots<ButtonSlots>(state);

  return (
    <state.root>
      {iconPosition !== 'after' && state.icon && <state.icon />}
      {!iconOnly && state.root.children}
      {iconPosition === 'after' && state.icon && <state.icon />}
    </state.root>
  );
};
```

The `assertSlots` method ensures the state has the expected slots. It also provides strong typings to ensure slots are renderable, meaning you can simply use `<state.slot />` and all properties provided to a `slot` creation will be already baked into it.

The `createElement` method is a custom JSX pragma ([What is JSX pragma?](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/blog/2019-08-02-what-is-jsx-pragma/)) that allows us to create slots in a JSX environment. It ensures that all race conditions between logic provided in the state hook and the render method are properly handled, and is required for `slot.always`, `slot.optional` and `assertSlots` to work properly.

## Wrap up

- Slots are a great way to replace specific parts of a component.
  There may be other extensibility mechanisms like theming, custom styles, or the hooks API
  to consider when slots isn't the best choice.
- The slots API provides a powerful extensibility mechanism with a minimal surface area.
  While the types are complex, they guide the caller with strong type safety.
- The slots API and the hooks API work together to let components create addressable locations for props and class styles.
