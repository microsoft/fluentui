## Customizing Components with Slots

Slots allow you to entirely replace one or more parts of a component.
You can completely change the layout, appearance, and behavior of a component part.

Fluent UI slots are conceptually similar to slots in other component libraries and frameworks.
However, there are implementation differences.

### Usage

If you have used any Fluent UI component, you are probably already using slots.

For example, button has two parts: the content and an optional icon.
Each of these is defined as a slot. This allows content to be placed within the button or passed to the icon prop.

```tsx
<Button icon={<MyFavoriteIcon />}>Text</Button>
```

It is helpful to think of a component as a visual template where each slot is positioned within the layout.
Many components have additional props that control layout and styling of slot content.

For example, the button component provides `iconPosition` to render the icon before or after the content.

### Slot Types

There are several types of content that can be passed to a slot.

- primitive (string, number, boolean)
- HTML element (div, span, img)
- JSX component (`<MyCustomControl />`)
- render function (() => React.ReactNode)
- props object (InputProps, IconProps)

Components may limit which types can be passed to a particular slot.

For example, the Avatar component has a badge slot.
Avatar limites this slot to components or render functions with PresenceBadgeProps props.

### Defaults

When a slot is not filled, components may render default content or skip rendering that part.

When a primitive or props object is passed to a slot,
the component will render a default component type and pass the value as props.

For example, SplitButton renders a `<MenuButton />` when the menuButton slot is passed a MenuButtonProps object.

### Conditional Rendering

Some components may have conditionally rendered slots. This means some slots won't render even when filled.

For example, Avatar has `label` slot that only renders when there is no image provided.
It also has an `icon` slot that only renders when there is neither an image nor a name provided.

### Identifying Slots

A property of a component can be identified as a slot by its type `Slot`.

In our composition system, slot props can accept 'shorthand' data such as primitive values and props objects, that they
use to determine what the entirety of the slot props bag should be.

Many components allow the primary content of the component to be specified as children.
The children can be thought of as the primary, unnamed slot for these components.

```tsx
<Menu>
  <MenuTrigger>
    <Button>Toggle menu</Button>
  </MenuTrigger>
  <MenuPopover>
    <MenuList>
      <MenuItem>New </MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>New Window</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem disabled>Open File</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>Open Folder</MenuItem>
    </MenuList>
  </MenuPopover>
</Menu>
```
