# Package Maturity Levels

This document explains the different maturity levels of Fluent UI v9 packages to help you make informed decisions about which components to use in your applications.

## Overview

Fluent UI v9 packages are categorized into three main maturity levels that indicate their stability and readiness for production use:

- **ðŸŸ¢ Stable**: Production-ready packages/components with stable APIs
- **ðŸŸ¡ Preview**: Initial stage of package/component development with intention to be propagated to Stable (part of Fluent core suite)
- **ðŸ”µ Compat**: Fluent UI v8 packages/components using solely v9 dependencies and APIs
- **ðŸ”´ Deprecated**: Unsupported packages

## Package Stages

### ðŸŸ¢ Stable Packages

**Characteristics:**

- Production-ready
- API is stable
- Version format: `9.x.x`
- Available from `@fluentui/react-components` suite
- Naming convention: `@fluentui/react-<name>`

**Examples:** react-button, react-text

**Import path:** `@fluentui/react-components`

### ðŸŸ¡ Preview Packages

**Characteristics:**

- Components that are not yet part of the stable suite (Early Access)
- Can introduced Breaking Changes
- Version format: `0.x.x`
- Not available from `@fluentui/react-components` suite
- Naming convention: `@fluentui/react-<name>-preview` (`-preview` suffix indicates it's a preview package)

**Examples:** react-nav-preview, react-virtualizer

**Import path:** `@fluentui/react-<name>-preview`

**ðŸ’¡ Exemptions:**

There are some packages that don't following "preview" conventions, although are considered as PREVIEW, because they were created before the preview phase was introduced:

- `@fluentui/theme`
- `@fluentui/react-virtualizer`

---

### ðŸ”µ Compat Packages

**Characteristics:**

- Fluent UI v8 components using solely v9 dependencies and APIs
- Maintain familiar v8 APIs for easier migration
- Bridge components during transition period from v8 to v9
- Gradually being replaced by stable v9 equivalents
- Can introduced breaking changes
- Version format: `0.x.x`
- Not available from `@fluentui/react-components` suite
- Naming convention: `@fluentui/react-<name>-compat` (`-compat` suffix indicates it's a compat package)

**Examples:** react-datepicker-compat, react-calendar-compat

**Import path:** `@fluentui/react-zzz-compat`

**When to use:**

Use during migration from v8 to v9 when native v9 equivalents aren't available or when you need time to gradually migrate complex implementations.

**Migration strategy:** Plan to migrate to native v9 components as they become available and stable.

### ðŸ”´ Deprecated Packages

**Characteristics:**

- Packages that are no longer supported or maintained
- Most of the time they have stable alternatives
- Version format: can vary, but typically `9.0.0-alpha.x` or `9.0.0-beta.x`
- Available from `@fluentui/react-components/unstable` suite (NOTE: suite `/unstable` api is DEPRECATED)
- Naming convention: `@fluentui/react-<name>`

**Examples:** react-alert, react-infobutton

**Migration strategy:**

| Deprecated Package | Stable Alternative                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| react-alert        | react-components / (react-toast, react-message-bar) |
| react-infobutton   | react-components / (react-infolabel)                |

Migrate to stable alternatives as soon as possible. Deprecated packages may not receive updates or fixes.
