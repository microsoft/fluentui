# Flex component Migration guide

## Overview:

To help with the migration we also offer a mixin and a shim that [can be checked here](/docs/migration-shims-v0-flexshim--default)

Before:

```tsx
import { Flex } from '@fluentui/react-northstar';
const Component = () => <Flex />;
```

After:

```tsx
import { Flex } from '@fluentui/react-migration-v0-v9';
const Component = () => <Flex />;
```

## How to migrate props:

## Migrate `content` prop

Move `content` to JSX children.

Before:

```tsx
import { Flex } from '@fluentui/react-northstar';
const Component = () => <Flex content="hi" />;
```

After:

```tsx
import { Flex } from '@fluentui/react-migration-v0-v9';
const Component = () => <Flex>hi</Flex>;
```

## Migrate style overrides

> Note: **If this is your first migration**, please read [the general guide on how to migrate styles](?path=/docs/concepts-migration-from-v0-custom-style-overrides--page). Also check examples in ["how to migrate styles" for Box component](./migrate-Box.md#Migrate-style-overrides).

### Example for migrate boolean `variables`:

Before:

```tsx
// in COMPONENT_NAME.tsx
import { Flex } from '@fluentui/react-northstar';

export const Component = () => <Flex variables={{ isSomething: true }} />;

// in flex-styles.ts
export const flexStyles = {
  root: ({ variables: { isSomething } }) => ({
    ...(isSomething && { color: 'red' }),
  }),
};
```

After:

```tsx
// in COMPONENT_NAME.tsx
import { Flex } from '@fluentui/react-migration-v0-v9';
import { useStyles } from './COMPONENT_NAME.styles.ts';

export const Component = () => {
  const classes = useStyles();

  return <Flex className={classes.root} />;
};
```

```tsx
// in COMPONENT_NAME.styles.ts
import { makeStyles } from '@fluentui/react-migration-v0-v9';

export const useStyles = makeStyles({
  root: { color: 'red' },
});
```

## Migrate flex items

Flex from Fluent UI v9 can work together with FlexItem from Fluent UI react-northstar.
For details about FlexItem migration, see [FlexItem component Migration guide](./migrate-FlexItem.md).

If `Flex.Item` (dot notation) is used, replace these with `FlexItem`, if the items have not yet been migrated to V9.
