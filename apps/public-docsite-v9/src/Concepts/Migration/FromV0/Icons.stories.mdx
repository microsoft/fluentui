# v0 - v9 Icon Catalog

This catalog can help you find the equivalent v9 icon if you are using v0 icons. Not all icons have a direct
equivalent, and you will see clearly when this is case in the catalog.

## Hover styles

V0 can handle switching between outline and filled versions of an icon automatically. However extra work is needed
to achieve the same effect in v9. You can read about these steps in [the official v9 Icon docs](?path=/docs/concepts-developer-icons-icons--page).
