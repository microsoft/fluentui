# Theme Migration

There are several important differences between v8 and v9 in how style and theme are managed.
During the migration process, you will likely have components from both versions side-by-side.

You may decide you want components to all look like v8, all look like v9, or be OK with a mixture but from the same color palette.

## Approach differences

### ThemeProvider -> FluentProvider

ThemeProvider sets theme values on the React context for use in CSS-in-JS.
FluentProvider applies theme values as CSS variables.

This change from CSS-in-JS themes to CSS variable themes is the biggest difference between v8 and v9 themes and styles.
Beyond consistency with the latest Fluent Design system, this change provides significant performance improvements and reduction of bundle sizes.

#### Portals

To be use v9 components inside v8 components like `Panel` & `Callout`, please enable [portal compatibility](?path=/docs/concepts-migration-from-v8-troubleshooting--page).

### Theme (v8) => Theme (v9)

Although they have different property structures, v8 and v9 `Theme` types both define the values for colors, fonts, layout, and effects.

Both use branded set of colors to generate different theme instances.
In v8 themes are seeded with `IPalette` along with some hard-coded colors.
In v9, themes are seeded with `BrandVariants` along with the set of global colors.

### IPalette -> BrandVariants

`IPalette` consists of 12 neutral colors, 9 theme colors, and 28 shared colors.
`BrandVariants` consists of a ramp of 16 theme colors.

### Theme.ComponentStyles -> tokens

v8 has a set of semantic colors that apply to specific parts of controls.
For example, `buttonBackgroundHovered`.
These component styles are used through a theme parameter when creating style objects.

v9 provides a collection of global tokens and alias tokens.
The global tokens define specific color, layout, and effect values but aren't used directly when applying theme styles in the code.
The alias tokens define general purpose color, layout, and effect values useful across many types of controls.
For example, 'colorNeutralBackground1Hover'.
A component like button would use this token when styling the background in the hover state.

### CSS-in-JS style objects -> makeStyles

In v8, custom styles were created by defining style objects in Javascript.
The types of style objects mapped closely to the structural hierarchy of the particular component.
Style objects could be built by parameterized functions taking theme object or other state to produce the result at runtime.

In v9, makeStyles helps define static styles that can be optimized at build time.
The makeStyles function returns a hook that can be used during component render.

### mergeStyles -> mergeClasses

In v8, mergeStyles combines a set of style objects to return a merged style object.
The ordering of the parameters determines which styles overwrote preceding styles.

In v9, mergeClasses takes a list of class names from makeStyles and returns the class names optimized for de-duping and minimal bundle size.

### styles -> className

In v8, the styles prop was provided on each Fluent UI component.
Callers could pass a style object to customize the style of a component.

In v9, there is no custom prop for styling. The React className prop is used.
Callers pass class names just like they would in any React code.
Class names are built using makeStyles and mergeClasses.

## Creating compatible themes

When you have v8 and v9 components running side-by-side, you will need to apply both a v8 theme and a v9 theme.
Add a v9 `FluentProvider` each place you have a v9 `ThemeProvider`.
Pass each their respective theme instances.

### Default themes

If you are using the default light or dark theme from v8, you can use the v9 `webLightTheme` or `webDarkTheme`.
This will give you pretty close consistency especially if you have moved to v9 for all of one component type.

For example, if all your buttons are v9 buttons then users likely won't notice small color differences between button and input components.
If you have a mixture of v8 and v9 buttons then the differences are more noticeable.

### Custom themes

Both v8 and v9 have helper methods for creating custom themes.
If you have custom v8 themes, you can define v9 themes with similar color sets.

You can do this by mapping the theme colors from the `IPalette` to the `BrandVariants`.
There are 7 more values in the `BrandVariants`, so you will need to expand the color set.

If this is too tedious a process, you can use shim methods to more easily create compatible themes.

### Compatible themes

If you want to minimize visual differences, you can make the themes more alike.

We recommend by making your v8 theme look more like v9.
You can do this through the [`createv8Theme`](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/blob/master/apps/public-docsite-v9/src/shims/ThemeShim/v8ThemeShim.ts) shim function.
This function takes a v9 theme and brand variants to produce a v8 theme with matching styles.

In the case you want to keep things looking like v8 for now, you have a couple of options.

You can use the [`createBrandVariants`](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/blob/master/apps/public-docsite-v9/src/shims/ThemeShim/v9BrandVariantsShim.ts) shim function.
This function takes a v8 `IPalette` and returns a `BrandVariants` you can use to create a v9 theme.
The brand colors are created from the palette using one of the available interpolation algorithms.
This is a good approach when you are concerned only about color compatibility.

You can use the [`createv9Theme`](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/blob/master/apps/public-docsite-v9/src/shims/ThemeShim/v9ThemeShim.ts) shim function.
This function takes a v8 theme and returns a v9 theme with as closely matching styles as possible.

> Important: Shim code is not published as a package.
> You will need to bring any shim code into your project in order to use it.
