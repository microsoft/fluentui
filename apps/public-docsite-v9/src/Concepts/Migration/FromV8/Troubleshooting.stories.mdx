## "I tried using the new components but there does not seem to be any styling applied to them. Am I doing something wrong?"

Components in version 8 could be used in isolation and still retain their default styling.
For components to be styled in version 9, they must be wrapped with `FluentProvider` with a theme passed to it.

We recommend placing the `FluentProvider` at the root of your app so that everything gets styled appropriately. The theme to use if you are coming from version 8 is `webLightTheme`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { FluentProvider, webLightTheme } from '@fluentui/react-components';

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <FluentProvider theme={webLightTheme}>
    <App />
  </FluentProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

## "I tried using the new components inside v8 Callouts, Panels, etc. but there does not seem to be any styling applied to them. Am I doing something wrong?"

Components in version v9 use CSS variables for styling, v9 components that are using [React Portals](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) handle this by default. Components like `Callout` & `Panel` in v8 don't do it, but this can be enabled with a compatibility package called `@fluentui/react-portal-compat`.

`PortalCompatProvider` should be an inner child of FluentProvider, no additional configuration is required for `@fluentui/react`.

```jsx
import { FluentProvider } from '@fluentui/react-components';
import { PortalCompatProvider } from '@fluentui/react-portal-compat';

function App() {
  return (
    <FluentProvider>
      <PortalCompatProvider>{/* your components */}</PortalCompatProvider>
    </FluentProvider>
  );
}
```

## "I tried uing a layered v8 component like Callout in a layered v9 component like Dialog and my Callout appears beneath my Dialog. What's going on?"

Both v9 and v8 layers set the same `z-index` value by default, which means the document order will resolve their z-positioning.
This can lead to inconsistent behavior because z-positioning depends on the order in which elements appear in the DOM.
Moreover, v8 `Layer` hosts have a tendency to linger in the DOM even after the element they are hosting is closed, which can add to this inconsistency.

Use `PortalMountNodeProvider` to handle this issue.

```jsx
import { FluentProvider, PortalMountNodeProvider } from '@fluentui/react-components';

function App() {
  // Get a reference to the v8 layer host
  const mountNode = document.getElementById('fluent-default-layer-host');

  return (
    <FluentProvider>
      <PortalMountNodeProvider mountNode={mountNode}>{/* your components */}</PortalMountNodeProvider>
    </FluentProvider>
  );
}
```

## "I managed to get the theme working but the components look different than they did previously, why is that?"

We are modernizing our components in version 9 to adhere to the latest guidelines in the Fluent Design Language. That is the reason for any visual differences you might notice.

## "What if I want to override a component's styles? Say, if I want to make them look like they did before? It seems like the styles prop does not exist anymore!"

The styling story in version 9 is very different to what existed in version 8. For one, we are moving away from providing a `styles` prop and are mostly focusing of providing styling via the `className` prop (if you are worried about how could you style every piece of a component via `className`, do not fret and keep reading).

We are also moving away from `mergeStyles` in favor of `makeStyles` from [`@griffel/react`](https://github.com/microsoft/griffel), a new in-house CSS-in-JS solution that allows for things like atomic classes and build-time optimization of styles.
