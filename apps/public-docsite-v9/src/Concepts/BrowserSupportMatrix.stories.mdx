## Browser Support Matrix

FluentUI fully supports browsers that are at or above the indicated versions below:

**Desktop Browsers:**

| Edge | Firefox | Chrome | Safari | Opera | Internet Explorer |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| >=84 | >=75    | >=84   | >=14.1 | >=73  | Not Supported     |

**Mobile Browsers:**

| Safari on iOS | Chrome for Android | Samsung |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| >=14.5        | >=84               | >=16    |

FluentUI will ensure that no browser, EcmaScript(ES), or CSS features that are incompatible with the support matrix laid out above are introduced.
FluentUI will not be providing our own polyfills for features that we expect our browser support matrix to already support.
There are often well-tested third-party polyfills available that applications can use to fill in the gaps.
Consumers who require the use/support of older browsers that don't support certain browser, ES, or CSS features (i.e. ResizeObserver),
will need to implement or use a third-party polyfill to provide the functionality. See the partial support section below for features
that may need to be polyfilled.

## Partial Support:

FluentUI provides partial support for the browsers below which will have limitations that may require consumers to use/implement polyfills to cover the support gaps.

**Desktop Browsers:**

| Edge | Firefox | Chrome | Safari | Opera | Internet Explorer |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| >=79 | >=69    | >=79   | >=13.1 | >=64  | Not Supported     |

**Mobile Browsers:**

| Safari on iOS | Chrome for Android | Samsung |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| >=13.4        | >=79               | >=14    |

List of features that are currently used in FluentUI that aren't supported out of the box by the partial support matrix above:

**Unsupported ECMAScript Features:**

1. Nullish Coalescing: Unsupported by Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera
2. Optional Chaining: Unsupported by Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera

**Unsupported CSS Features:**

1.  Flex gap: Unsupported by Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Safari on IOS, Chrome on Android
2.  CSS min, max, clamp: Unsupported by Firefox and Opera
3.  CSS revert value: Unsupported by Firefox and Opera

## Browser Support Going Forward

With an eye towards being a modern library, FluentUI will follow a yearly audit process to evaluate and update the current browser support matrix to keep pace
with the ever evolving ecosystem of the web. This will allow the team to utilize modern tools and improve overall engineering efficiency while also providing
consumers with performance and bundlesize improvements. These yearly audits will give FluentUI a reasonable timeframe to evaluate, decide and give notice if browser support
changes are made.
