## ECMAScript Target

FluentUI will be targetting ES2020 as its Typescript target. FluentUI will not be performing any down-level transpilation below ES2020
which means that consumers who need to support older browsers (such as those that only support up to ES6) are responsible for transpiling down the FluentUI
library to fit their needs. This ensures that consumers who support modern browsers are not penalized and can get the added benefit of a reduced bundle size that
the latest ES standards provide.

## Full Browser Support Matrix

FluentUI fully supports browsers that are at or above the indicated versions below:

**Desktop Browsers:**

| Edge | Firefox | Chrome | Safari | Opera | Internet Explorer |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| >=84 | >=75    | >=84   | >=14.1 | >=73  | Not Supported     |

**Mobile Browsers:**

| Safari on iOS | Chrome for Android | Samsung |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| >=14.5        | >=84               | >=16    |

FluentUI will ensure that no browser, EcmaScript(ES), or CSS features that are incompatible with the support matrix laid out above are introduced.
FluentUI will not be providing our own polyfills for features that we expect our browser support matrix to already support.
There are often well-tested third-party polyfills available that applications can use to fill in the gaps.
Consumers who require the use/support of older browsers that don't support certain browser, ES, or CSS features (i.e. ResizeObserver),
will need to implement or use a third-party polyfill to provide the functionality. See the partial support section below for features
that may need to be polyfilled.

## Partial Browser Support Matrix:

FluentUI provides partial support for the browsers below which will have limitations that will require consumers to transpile down and/or use polyfills to cover the support gaps.

**Desktop Browsers:**

| Edge | Firefox | Chrome | Safari | Opera | Internet Explorer |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| >=79 | >=69    | >=79   | >=13.1 | >=64  | Not Supported     |

**Mobile Browsers:**

| Safari on iOS | Chrome for Android | Samsung |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| >=13.4        | >=79               | >=14    |

List of features that are currently used in FluentUI that aren't supported out of the box by the partial support matrix above:

**Unsupported CSS Features:**

1.  Flex gap: Unsupported by Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Opera, Safari, Safari on IOS, Chrome on Android
2.  CSS min, max, clamp: Unsupported by Firefox and Opera
3.  CSS revert value: Unsupported by Firefox and Opera

**Unsupported ECMAScript Features:**
As outlined in the very beginning, FluentUI will be using ES2020 as its Typescript target; so ES2020 features such as nullish coalescing and optional chaining are already being utilized by the library.
These ES2020 features are not guaranteed to work in all browsers within the partial support matrix so consumers will need to perform down-level transpilation of the library.

## Browser Support Expectations:

**Consumer Expectations:**

1. Consumers are expected to perform down-level transpilation of the FluentUI library should they need to support browsers that fall below the full support matrix.
2. Consumers are responsible for working around browser, ECMA and CSS feature gaps caused by needing to support browsers that fall below the full support matrix.

**Developer Expectations:**

1. FluentUI developers and contributors are internally expected to develop against the partial browser support matrix.
   This means that no code which causes applications to crash on the partially supported browsers (with the exception of ES syntax which are transpilable by the consumer)
   should be present in the library. Should any application breaking errors be discovered in the future, FluentUI will be responsible for fixing it internally.
2. FluentUI developers and contributors reserve the right to use features that fall in between the partial and full browser support matrices (like flex gap) as
   long as they don't result in applications crashing.

## Browser Support Going Forward

With an eye towards being a modern library, FluentUI will follow a yearly audit process to evaluate and update the current browser support matrix to keep pace
with the ever evolving ecosystem of the web. This will allow the team to utilize modern tools and improve overall engineering efficiency while also providing
consumers with performance and bundlesize improvements. These yearly audits will give FluentUI a reasonable timeframe to evaluate, decide and give notice if browser support
changes are made.
