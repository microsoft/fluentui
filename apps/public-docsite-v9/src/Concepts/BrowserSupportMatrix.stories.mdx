## Browser Support Matrix

FluentUI supports browsers that are at or above the indicated versions below:

**Desktop Browsers:**

| Edge | Firefox | Chrome | Safari | Opera | Internet Explorer |
| ---- | ------- | ------ | ------ | ----- | ----------------- |
| >=84 | >=75    | >=84   | >=14.1 | >=73  | Not Supported     |

**Mobile Browsers:**

| Safari on iOS | Chrome for Android | Samsung |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| >=14.5        | >=84               | >=16    |

FluentUI will ensure that no browser, EcmaScript(ES), or CSS features that are incompatible with the support matrix laid out above are introduced.
FluentUI will not be providing polyfills for features that we expect our browser support matrix to already support. This means that consumers who require the
use/support of older browsers that don't support certain browser, ES, or CSS features (i.e. `ResizeObserver`),
are expected to implement their own polyfills or use a third-party one.

## Browser Support Going Forward

With an eye towards being a modern library, FluentUI will follow a yearly audit process to evaluate and update the current browser support matrix to keep pace
with the ever evolving ecosystem of the web. This will allow the team to utilize modern tools and improve overall engineering efficiency while also providing
consumers with performance and bundlesize improvements. These yearly audits will give FluentUI a reasonable timeframe to evaluate, decide and give notice if browser support
changes are made.
