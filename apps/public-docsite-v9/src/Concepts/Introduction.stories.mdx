<h2 className="fluent">Overview</h2>
<div className="fluent-text">

Fluent UI React Components is a set of UI components and utilities resulting from an effort to converge the set of React based component libraries in production today: `@fluentui/react` and `@fluentui/react-northstar`.

Each component is designed to adhere to the following standards:

- **Customizable**: Fluent-styled components by default, but easy to integrate your own brand and theme
- **Performance**: Optimized for render performance
- **Bundle size**: Refactored and slimmed down components that allow you to include the packages and dependencies you need
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 compliant and tested by trusted testers
- **Design to Code**: Stay up to date with Fluent Design Language changes via Design Tokens
