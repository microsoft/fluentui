# React Version Support

> ℹ️ **Note**: Our migration docs focus solely on FluentUI related changes.

If you're migrating between React major versions, please refer to the official React documentation for comprehensive migration guides.

For migrating your codebase TypeScript types, you can leverage [Types React Codemod](https://github.com/eps1lon/types-react-codemod)

## React 17

Full support starting `@fluentui/react-components` v9.0.0.

## React 18

Full support starting `@fluentui/react-components` v9.66.0.

#### Runtime/API changes:

NONE

#### TypeScript types changes:

##### Slot Children as a Function

Because `@types/react@18` Breaking Changes, we needed to loosen `Slot` children property to `any`.

This change will affect users that use `Slot` children as a function in conjunction with TypeScript strict mode.

If that's your case, TypeScript will fail on `noImplicitAny`. To mitigate this you need to add type assertions (`satisfies SlotRenderFunction<T>`)

Before:

```tsx
import * as React from 'React';

<Button
  // children was inferred as union of ReactNode and SlotRenderFunction
  icon={{ children: (Component, props) => <Component {...props /> }}
>
Label
</Button>
```

After:

```tsx
import * as React from 'React';
import { type SlotRenderFunction } from '@fluentui/react-utilities';

<Button
  icon={{
    // children is now `any` and needs to be asserted as `SlotRenderFunction`
    children: ((Component, props) => <Component {...props} />) satisfies SlotRenderFunction<
      React.ComponentProps<'span'>
    >,
  }}
>
  Label
</Button>;
```
