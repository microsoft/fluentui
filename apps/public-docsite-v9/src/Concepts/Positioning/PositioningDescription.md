Fluent components that make use of positioning can all be configured in the same way. Some components which make use of
positioned DOM elements are:

- Tooltip
- Menu
- Popover

Fluent components that have slots which are positioned will always expose a `positioning` prop where the positioning of
the slot can be configured.

Below you can try out the different positioning options in the playground. Further examples try to explain more clearly
different configuration options for the `positioning` prop.
