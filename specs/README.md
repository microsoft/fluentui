# Component Specs

This is the living space for the specs that lay the foundation on which our components are built. Each component should have a corresponding spec here that outlines at least, but is not limited to:

- Component description
- Variant considerations
- Recommended API
- Recommended DOM structure
- Recommended slots
- Behavioral information
  - Component states
  - Keyboard, cursor and touch interaction
- Accessibility concerns
  - Of the component developer
  - Of the user
- Component tokens
