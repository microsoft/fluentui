For _how-to_ questions and other non-bugs, please use StackOverflow instead of Github issues. You can tag your questions with [office-ui-fabric] [fluentui-react] [fluentui](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/office-ui-fabric).

If you are a Microsoft employee you can also join the "Fluent UI Community" Teams channel.
