                Thanks for taking the time to enter an issue. However, it seems that there aren't enough details here for this issue to be actionable.


                When issues are created, we need details such as:

                1. Which Fluent UI component is causing the issue

                1. Which package name and version the component is from

                1. Specific, complete steps to reproduce the issue

                1. What behaviors and attributes are missing or incorrect

                1. What you expected and what is actually happening

                1. Confirmation that the problem reproduces in isolation


                Without a clear understanding of these details, it's not possible to take clear action on issues. We are unable to meet your expectations, properly address the root cause, and make changes without affecting the expectations of other consumers.


                Please provide these additional details as you are able. The default issue template provides an outline of these details and is viewable when creating a new issue. Additionally, if this is an accessibility issue, please see [Accessibility Troubleshooting](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Accessibility-Troubleshooting) in our wiki for more guidance. If these details cannot be provided, please kindly close the issue.


                Thank you for your patience.
