A Sankey chart visualizes a flow from one entity to another. Its goal is to clearly show the path of a depicted property. By hovering over a path, the user can highlight the source and destination of flow of this information.

The height of each column is proportional to the size of data, similar to a pie chart. Sankey also utilizes streams to visualize relationships between different column groups and their associated values.

Sankey charts are best used to visualize important relationships in a multi-level flow and help to investigate and monitor flow of information within workflows. Eg - Flow of mail data through different ip addresses.
