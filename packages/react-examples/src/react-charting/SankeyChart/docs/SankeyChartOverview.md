    A sankey diagram is a visualization used to depict a flow from one set of values to another. The things
    being connected are called nodes and the connections are called links. Sankeys are best used when you want
    to show a many-to-many mapping between two domains (e.g., universities and majors) or multiple paths
    through a set of stages
