Horizontal stacked bar chart displays multiple series of data as stacked bars, with each bar representing a category. The bars are stacked alongside each other, with the length of each bar representing the value of the category of the series.

The stacked bar chart is a 100% chart. This means the sum of all categories sums up to 100% width of the chart.
