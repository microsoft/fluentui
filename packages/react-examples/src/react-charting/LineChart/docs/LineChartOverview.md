A line chart is a visual representation of data that shows the relationship between two variables, often used to show trends over a period of time or number line. Line charts plot data at regular intervals connected by lines. Multi-line charts enable comparison between multiple series over the same x domain.

Time intervals are traditionally mapped to the horizontal axis. Data values are mapped to the vertical axis.
