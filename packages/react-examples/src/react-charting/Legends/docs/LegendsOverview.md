A legend describes data visualized in the chart. The legends can wrap based upon the space available for them. If there is not enough space to show all legends on a single line, the legends fall into an overflow menu. A button is shown to open the overflow menu and displays the number of legends in it.

Refer to this [Readme](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/blob/master/packages/react-charting/README.md) on how to start using the `@fluentui/react-charting` library.
