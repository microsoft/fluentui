    Grouped vertical bar chart is slightly different than a vertical stacked bar chart. In a vertical stacked
    bar chart, the bars are stacked one on top of the other. In a grouped vertical bar chart, the vertical
    bars are aligned next to each other in groups. In stacked bar chart, the reference point for each bar is
    either the x axis or another bar in the stack. For grouped vertical bar chart, each bar has x axis as the
    reference point. Having a common reference point helps in better comparison between different values in
    the chart.

    The bar labels are shown by default. Set the <code>hideLabels</code> prop to hide them.
