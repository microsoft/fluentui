A grouped vertical bar chart displays multiple series of data as a group of bars, with each bar denoting a category. The bars are grouped together side by side, with each group denoting a different series.

Effectively, a grouped vertical bar chart can slice data across 2 dimensions - (1) A dimension along the x axis and (2) Groups within the first dimension. And the y-axis plots the values of each category. Each bar in a group is colored differently to differentiate among categories within the group.
