### Layout

A stacked bar chart is used to emphasize the composition of a category and how individual components contribute to it.
On the other hand, a grouped bar chart is used to compare distinct values across various categories or groups separately.

Refer to Vertical Bar Chart page for common layout guidance.

### Customizing the chart

- Use the `barwidth` prop to customize the width of each bar in the chart. When set to `undefined` or `'default'`, the bar width defaults to 16px. When set to `'auto'` (which is only applicable to string x-axis), the bar width is calculated from padding values. For a fixed bar width, specify an absolute pixel value like `40`.

- Use the `maxBarWidth` prop to limit the width of bars to a specified number of pixels.

- Use the `xAxisInnerPadding` and `xAxisOuterPadding` props to adjust the padding between groups and the padding before the first group and after the last group, respectively. These props accept values between 0 and 1, representing a fraction of the `step`, which is the interval between the start of a group and the start of the next group. These props are particularly relevant when using a string x-axis. By default, the inner padding is set to `2 / (2 + groupWidthInTermsOfBarWidth)`, maintaining a 2:1 spacing ratio. This default value is calculated at runtime using the formula:
  $$
  innerPadding = {spaceBetweenGroups \over spaceBetweenGroups + groupWidth}
  $$
