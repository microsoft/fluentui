Horizontal multistacked bar chart displays multiple series of data as stacked bars, with each bar representing a category. The bars are stacked alongside each other, with the length of each bar representing the value of the category of the series.

Additionally, it allows grouping subcategories. Each subcategory can be displayed in a bar of its own to provide further breakdown.

The multistacked bar chart is a 100% chart. This means the sum of all categories sums up to 100% width of the chart.
