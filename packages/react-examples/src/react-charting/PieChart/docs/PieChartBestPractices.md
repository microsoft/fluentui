### Layout

- For high cardinality scenarios where the slices are very small, they can be grouped together to form a bigger chunk.
- Values should always be displayed for easier chart comprehension. There is a 2px space between the chart and the text. The value is centered in relationship to the slice it describes. That can be offset if an overlap happens.
- Minimum padding is 16px around the chart. That applies to the version with title to accommodate space for values. The chart is centered within the area.
- The slice labels should be short and concise as they take additional screen space outside the pie visual.

### Content

Segments should be ordered from largest to smallest in clockwise direction.

Pie Labels for each segment (optional)

Divider gaps between segments to improve readability.
