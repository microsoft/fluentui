A pie chart is a circular visual representation used to illustrate the composition or distribution of a single data set. It divides the whole data into segments, resembling slices of a pie, where each slice represents a distinct category or component. The size of each slice is directly proportional to the quantity it represents within the entire dataset.

Pie chart does not have the benefits of donut chart and, therefore, it is rarely chosen. Pie chart has an advantage in certain reading scenarios only, where users want to compare the ratio of angles or areas of the slices.
