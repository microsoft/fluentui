Also known as org chart, a tree diagram is used to represent hierarchy in a tree-like structure. A tree chart starts with a parent node. Edges, or lines, connect to nodes to represent the relationship between them. Finally, leaf nodes are members that have no child nodes.

Tree diagrams are best used to show hierarchy and relationship between entities. They don’t require any metrics – the information can be entirely composed of text. They can also be used to visualize decision trees with each node representing the rules and data distribution.
