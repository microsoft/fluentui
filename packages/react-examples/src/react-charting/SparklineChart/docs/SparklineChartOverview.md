A sparkline is a very small area chart without axes or coordinates. It is useful for quick and high-level evaluation of trends. It can be an effective solution for presenting an overview of multiple series (high cardinality of data) simultaneously while maximizing legibility.

From Edward Tufte: "A sparkline is a small intense, simple, word-sized graphic with typographic resolution. Sparklines mean that graphics are no longer cartoonish special occasions with captions and boxes, but rather sparkline graphics can be anywhere a word or number is present - embedded in a sentence, table, headline, map, spreadsheet, graphic."
