Donut charts are used to show proportion, which expresses a partial value in comparison to a total value. These types of charts are best to show percentage of individual parts in comparison to a whole, where the change over time is not important to visualize. They are circular statistical graphics divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion.

Refer to this [Readme](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/blob/master/packages/react-charting/README.md) on how to start using the `@fluentui/react-charting` library.
