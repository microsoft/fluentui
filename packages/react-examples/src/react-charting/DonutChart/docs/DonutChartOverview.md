    Donut charts show a percentage of a whole. They are circular statistical graphics divided into slices to
    illustrate numerical proportion. Donut charts have an empty center where a numerical value can be shown.

  <p>
    The arc length of each data set in a donut is proportional to the quantity it represents, which can also
    be expressed as a horizontal bar chart.

    <strong>Note:</strong> Donut Charts typically represent two data points. Representing more data in a
    circular chart (as seen in the second example) is known by the MADS team as a Pie Chart.

    The arc labels are hidden by default. Set the <code>hideLabels</code> prop to false to show them.
