### Accessibility

- Users "Enter" into the graph and can use both arrow and tab keys to navigate through.
- The first tab stop will stop on the graph and give a description of what type of graph it is.
- Each section of the graph is readable via screen readers. The user can navigate through the entire area plot by using Left and Right arrow keys.

### Do's

1. **Use for Correlation Analysis**:

   - Scatter charts are ideal for identifying relationships or correlations between two numerical variables (e.g., sales vs. profit).

### Don'ts

1. **Limit Data Points**:

   - Avoid overcrowding the chart with too many data points, as it can make the visualization cluttered and hard to interpret.

2. **Use Bubble Size Wisely**:
   - In bubble charts, ensure the size of the bubbles is proportional to the third variable and does not obscure other data points.
