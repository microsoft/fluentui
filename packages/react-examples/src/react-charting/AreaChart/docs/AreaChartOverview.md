Area charts are graphical representations of data that display quantitative data points connected by lines and filled with colors to create a visual representation of trends and patterns. The area between the line and the x-axis is colored, which helps in emphasizing the cumulative total or the overall magnitude of the data. They are a slight variation of single line charts, and generally can be used interchangeably.

Stacked area charts are great at communicating how multiple data series relate to the total value. It illustrates how each series compares to the other in their contributions to the total. The baseline is moving in stacked area charts, rather than sharing a common baseline in overlapping areas.
