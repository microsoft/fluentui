A horizontal bar chart is a chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values they represent. This type of chart is particularly useful when the intention is to show comparisons among various categories and the labels for those categories are long.

Horizontal bar chart with axis is a version of horizontal bar chart that has the x and y axis present.
This chart is same as the vertical bar chart except that the bars are aligned horizontally.
