In a user interface, an icon is an image that represents an application, a capability, or some other concept or specific entity with meaning for the user. An icon is usually selectable but can also be a non-selectable image, such as a company's logo.

For a list of icons, visit our [icon documentation](#/styles/web/icons).

Note that icons are not bundled by default and typically must be loaded by calling `initializeIcons` from `@fluentui/react/lib/Icons` at the root of your application. See the [icon documentation](#/styles/web/icons#fabric-react) for more details.
