### Layout

- Use a single check box when there's only one selection to make or choice to confirm. Selecting a blank check box selects it. Selecting it again clears the check box.
- Use multiple check boxes when one or more options can be selected from a group. Unlike radio buttons, selecting one check box will not clear another check box.

### Content

- Separate two groups of check boxes with headings rather than positioning them one after the other.
- Use sentence-style capitalization—only capitalize the first word. For more info, see [Capitalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/capitalization) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.
- Don't use end punctuation (unless the check box label absolutely requires multiple sentences).
- Use a sentence fragment for the label, rather than a full sentence.
- Make it easy for people to understand what will happen if they select or clear a check box.
