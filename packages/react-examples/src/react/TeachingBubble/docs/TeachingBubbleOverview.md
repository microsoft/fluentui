A teaching bubble (`TeachingBubble`) brings attention to a new or important feature, with the goal of increasing engagement with the feature. A teaching bubble typically follows a coach mark.

Use teaching bubbles sparingly. Consider how frequently people will see it, and how many they’ll see across their entire experience.
