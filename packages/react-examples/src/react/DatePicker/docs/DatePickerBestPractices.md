### Layout

- Use the control the way it’s designed and built. Don’t break it apart.

### Content

- The control provides the date in a specific format. If the date can be entered in an input field, provide helper text in the appropriate format.
- The control provides English strings by default. For localized apps, you must override these using the `strings` prop.
