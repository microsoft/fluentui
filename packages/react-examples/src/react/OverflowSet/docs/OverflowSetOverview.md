The OverflowSet is a flexible container component that is useful for displaying a primary set of content with additional content in an overflow callout. Note that the example below is only an example of how to render the component, not a specific use case.

### Accessibility

By default, the OverflowSet is simply `role=group`. If you used as a menu, you will need to add `role="menubar"` and add proper aria roles to each rendered item (`menuitem`, `menuitemcheckbox`, `menuitemradio`)
