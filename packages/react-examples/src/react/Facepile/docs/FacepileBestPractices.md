### Layout

- The face pile empty state should only include an "Add" button. Another variant is to use an input field with placeholder text instructing people to add a person. See the people picker component for the menu used to add people to the face pile list.
- When there is only one person in the face pile, consider using their name next to the face or initials.
- When there is a need to show the face pile expanded into a vertical list, include a downward chevron button. Selecting the chevron opens a standard list view of people.
- When the face pile exceeds a max number of 5 people, show a button at the end of the list indicating how many are not being shown. Clicking or tapping on the overflow would open a standard list view of people.
- The component can include an "Add" button which can be used for quickly adding a person to the list.
- When hovering over a person in the face pile, include a tooltip or people card that offers more information about that person.
