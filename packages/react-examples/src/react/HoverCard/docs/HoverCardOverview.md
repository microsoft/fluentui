Hover cards (`HoverCard`) show commands and information, such as metadata and activity, when someone hovers over an item.

- Tabbing with a keyboard to the element triggering the HoverCard to open on focus (see first example). In this case no further navigation within the card is available and navigating to the next element will close the card.
- Tabbing with a keyboard to the element triggering the HoverCard and opening when the hotKey is pressed (see second example). When the card is opened it will automatically focus the first focusable element of the card content.
