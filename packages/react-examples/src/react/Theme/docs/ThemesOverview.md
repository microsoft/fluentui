Fluent UI React components are themeable. We provide a set of sensible defaults, but you can override [colors](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/colors/theme-slots) or [fonts](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/typography) individually. See [this wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/How-to-apply-theme-to-Fluent-UI-React-components) for more details.

## Fluent 2 Themes for version 8

We may have noticed that we added a couple of themes in the examples: Fluent 2 Web Light and Fluent 2 Web Dark.

The Fluent 2 design system is the default theme and style for [Fluent UI React v9](https://react.fluentui.dev/).
These custom themes allow v8 controls to look like v9.

However, this is only a set of custom styles.
You don't get any of v9's new features, faster performance, improved accessibility, and reduced bundle size.
We recommend you migrate to the v9 component library to get the best Fluent 2 design experience.
