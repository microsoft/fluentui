Modals are temporary pop-ups that take focus from the page or app and require people to interact with them. Unlike a dialog box (`Dialog`), a modal should be used for hosting lengthy content, such as privacy statements or license agreements, or for asking people to perform complex or multiple actions, such as changing settings.
