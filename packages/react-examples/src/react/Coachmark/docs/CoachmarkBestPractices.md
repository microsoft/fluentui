### Layout

- Only one coach mark and teaching bubble combo should be displayed at a time.
- Coach marks can be standalone or sequential. Sequential coach marks should be used sparingly to walk through complex multistep interactions. It’s recommended that a sequence of coach marks doesn’t exceed three steps.
- Coach marks are designed to only hold teaching bubbles.
- Coach mark size, color, and animation shouldn’t be altered.

### Accessibility

- Coach marks are difficult to access for screenreaders and keyboard users. Consider providing an alternative display of the information in the coach mark through text documentation or a video walkthrough.
- Keyboard users can press Alt+C to open the coach mark.
