### Layout

- Make it clear which item the rating pertains to by making sure the layout and grouping are clear when several items are on the page.
- Don't use the rating component for data that has a continuous range, such as the brightness of a photo. Instead, use a slider.

### Content

- Use a five-star rating system.
- Use sentence-style capitalization—only capitalize the first word. For more info, see [Capitalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/style-guide/capitalization) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.
