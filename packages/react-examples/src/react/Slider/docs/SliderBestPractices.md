### Layout

- Don't use a slider for binary settings.
- Don't use a continuous slider if the range of values is large.
- Don't use for a range with fewer than three values.
- Sliders are typically horizontal but can be vertical, when needed.

### Content

- Include a label indicating what value the slider changes.
- Use step points if you don't want the slider to allow arbitrary values between minimum and maximum.
