CommandBar is a surface that houses commands that operate on the content of
the window, panel, or parent region it resides above. CommandBars are one of the most
visible and recognizable ways to surface commands, and can be an intuitive
method for interacting with content on the page; however, if overloaded or
poorly organized, they can be difficult to use and hide valuable commands from
your user. CommandBars can also display a search box for finding content, hold
simple commands as well as menus, or display the status of ongoing actions.

Commands should be sorted in order of importance, from left-to-right or right-to-left
depending on the culture. Secondarily, organize commands in logical
groupings for easier recall. CommandBars work best when they display no more
than 5-7 commands. This helps users quickly find your most valuable features.
If you need to show more commands, consider using the overflow menu. If you
need to render status or viewing controls, these go on the right side of the
CommandBar (or left side if in a left-to-right experience). Do not display
more than 2-3 items on the right side as it will make the overall CommandBar
difficult to parse.

All command items should have an icon and a label. Commands can render as
labels only as well. In smaller widths, commands can just use icon only, but
only for the most recognizable and frequently used commands. All other
commands should go into an overflow where text labels can be shown.
