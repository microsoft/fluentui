Breadcrumbs should be used as a navigational aid in your app or site. They indicate the current pageâ€™s location within a hierarchy and help the user understand where they are in relation to the rest of that hierarchy. They also afford one-click access to higher levels of that hierarchy.

Breadcrumbs are typically placed, in horizontal form, under the masthead or navigation of an experience, above the primary content area.
