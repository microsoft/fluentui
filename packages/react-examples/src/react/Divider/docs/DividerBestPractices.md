Use a divider component to show a sectional or continuity change in the content between two blocks of information. The spacing around the divider is generally determined by the content surrounding it.

There are two recommended divider color combinations:

1. #C8C8C8/neutralTertiaryAlt divider when used within an #F4F4F4/neutralLighter layout
1. #EAEAEA/neutralLight divider when used within an #FFFFFF/white layout
