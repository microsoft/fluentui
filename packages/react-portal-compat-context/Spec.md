## Accessibility

Base accessibility information is included in the design document. After the spec is filled and review, outcomes from it need to be communicated to design and incorporated in the design document.

- Decide whether to use **native element** or folow **ARIA** and provide reasons
- Identify the **[ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/) pattern** and, if the component is listed there, follow its specification as possible.
- Identify accessibility **variants**, the `role` ([ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)) of the component, its `slots` and `aria-*` props.
- Describe the **keyboard navigation**: Tab Oder and Arrow Key Navigation. Describe any other keyboard **shortcuts** used
- Specify texts for **state change announcements** - [ARIA live regions
  ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) (number of available items in dropdown, error messages, confirmations, ...)
- Identify UI parts that appear on **hover or focus** and specify keyboard and screen reader interaction with them
- List cases when **focus** needs to be **trapped** in sections of the UI (for dialogs and popups or for hierarchical navigation)
- List cases when **focus** needs to be **moved programatically** (if parts of the UI are appearing/disappearing or other cases)
