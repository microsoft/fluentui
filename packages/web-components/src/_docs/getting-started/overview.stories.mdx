## Overview

## What are the Fluent UI Web Components?

Fluent UI Web Components is a collection of technologies built on Web Components and modern Web Standards, designed to help you efficiently tackle some of the most common challenges in website and application design and development.
`@fluentui/web-components`s a library of Web Components that composes `@microsoft/fast-foundation` and supports Microsoft's Fluent design language.

### What are Web Components?

"Web Components" is an umbrella term that refers to a collection of web standards focused on enabling the creation of custom HTML elements. Some of the standards that are under the umbrella include the ability to define new HTML tags, plug into a standard component lifecycle, encapsulate HTML rendering and CSS, parameterize CSS, skin components, and more. Each of these platform features is defined by the W3C and has shipped in every major browser today.

### How does Fluent UI Web Components leverage Web Components?

One of Fluent UI Web Components's driving principals is "strive to adopt open, web standards-based approaches as much as possible." To that end, Fluent UI Web Components is built directly on the W3C Web Component standards mentioned above, and does not create its own component model. This allows components built with FAST to function the same as built-in, native HTML elements. You do not need a framework to use FAST components but you can use them in combination with any framework or library of your choice.

### How can Fluent UI Web Components help me?

To understand how Fluent UI Web Components can help you, let's take a look at the Fluent UI Web Components tech stack from top to bottom.

At the top of the stack, Fluent UI provides two sets of Web Components: `@fluentui/web-components` and `@microsoft/fast-components`. Both of these libraries include a common set of components found in many websites and apps. Example components include button, menu, tree-view, tab, card, modal, and more. So, what is the difference between these two libraries? The answer is that each library implements a different _design system_. `@fluentui/web-components` implements Microsoft's Fluent Design System. They look and feel like the components found in products like Windows, Office, Teams, and Edge. If you like the Fluent Design System or are building experiences designed to fit naturally into the Microsoft ecosystem, this is the component set you'll want to use. Alternatively, `@microsoft/fast-components` provides an industry-focused design system with more customization options. We call this system "FAST Frame". If you're looking to integrate FAST components into an existing site or app, or if you need more control over the theme of the components, this is the option you'll want to start with.

What if you're not just looking for a set of components to use, but you also need to implement a custom _design system_? This is where the second level of the stack comes into play. `@microsoft/fast-foundation` provides foundational building blocks that can be assembled to create new design systems and component libraries. For example, if you wanted to implement Google's Material Design, you could do that using `@microsoft/fast-foundation`. You could also implement something like Twitter Bootstrap. Both `@fluentui/web-components` and `@microsoft/fast-components` assemble the building blocks of `@microsoft/fast-foundation` to create their component sets. What types of building blocks are we talking about though? Perhaps the most valuable feature of the foundation is that it provides base component behaviors and templates for the standard components. So, if you want to implement a tree-view in your design system, for example, you would use the foundation base component behavior and template, but combine it with your own styles. The foundation components implement the state management, accessibility, keyboard navigation, and extensibility/composition model so you don't have to write that code. Additionally, foundation provides facilities for dynamic style behaviors, CSS property management, algorithmic color, RTL, high contrast, and more. You don't have to write any of that. Just assemble the building blocks and add your styles to create your own component library, expressing your own design system.

So far we've talked about using existing components and creating new design systems and component libraries from existing pieces. But FAST enables you to create completely new web components as well. Enter `@microsoft/fast-element`, the lowest level part of the FAST tech stack. `@microsoft/fast-element` provides a thin layer of opinions on top of Web Components, lifting the level of abstraction just enough to make it easier and FASTer to build components. `@microsoft/fast-element` helps by providing attribute/property syncing, rich Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), efficient template rendering/update, style composition, and much more. The entire `@microsoft/fast-element` library, _without_ tree-shaking, is around 10kb minified and GZipped. It was designed for tree-shaking from the beginning, so any feature you don't use when building a component will be removed during build, allowing for highly efficient optimized payloads as small as 4.5k.

## Where should I start?

We hope you're excited by the possibilities that FAST presents. But, you may be wondering where to start. Here are a few statements that describe various members of our community.
