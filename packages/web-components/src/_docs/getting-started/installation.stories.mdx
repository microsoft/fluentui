## Installation

To install the component packages using NPM:

```shell
npm install --save @fluentui/web-components
```

Or with yarn:

```shell
yarn add @fluentui/web-components
```

## Registering & using the web components

To use a Fluent UI Web Component as a custom element in HTML, the custom element must be registered.
Importing the component definition into your JavaScript bundle and registering it with a `DesignSystem` will register the custom element with the platform:

```js
import { fluentButton, provideFluentDesignSystem } from '@fluentui/web-components';

provideFluentDesignSystem().register(fluentButton());
```

As a shortcut, if you wish to easily register all available components, rather than registering each one, you can use the following pattern with either design system:

```js
import { allComponents, provideFluentDesignSystem } from '@fluentui/web-components';

provideFluentDesignSystem().register(allComponents);
```

> When working with a tree-shaking supporting bundler such as Webpack or Rollup, you will want to import and register the individual components. This will ensure that any unused components are tree-shaken out of your builds.

> Looking to integrate with a front-end framework or bundler? Check out [the integration docs](?path=/story/integrations-introduction--page).

### From CDN

A pre-bundled script that contains all APIs needed to use the components is available on CDN. You can use this script by adding [`type="module"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) to the script element and then importing from the CDN. Here's how that would look:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@fluentui/web-components"></script>
  </head>
  <!-- ... -->
</html>
```

If you are using Fluent UI Web Components (or the FAST components) from the CDN, there is no need to register the components. The CDN script includes code that automatically sets up the design system and registers all the components.

> The above CDN location points to the latest release of `@fluentui/web-components`. When you deploy your site or app, you should instead import the specific version you have developed and tested with.

For simplicity, this documentation assumes the library has been installed from NPM, but you can always replace the import location with the CDN URL.

## Add components

With the components registered, add any component to the HTML.

```html
<!-- ... -->
<fluent-button>Hello world</fluent-button>
<!-- ... -->
```
