## Introduction to Integrations

The Fluent UI Web Component libraries, composed from [FAST Components](https://www.fast.design/), can be used on their own to build modern web sites and applications, but are also designed to be used in combination with a wide variety of existing technologies.
This section is dedicated to helping you get Fluent UI web components working with your preferred stack.

- [Angular](?path=/story/integrations-angular--page)
- [ASP.NET](?path=/story/integrations-asp-net--page)
- [Aurelia](?path=/story/integrations-aurelia--page)
- [Blazor](?path=/story/integrations-blazor--page)
- [React](?path=/story/integrations-react--page)
- [Vue](?path=/story/integrations-vue--page)
- [Webpack](?path=/story/integrations-webpack--page)

Not seeing an integration for your preferred technology? We'd be happy to work with you to add it. Feel free to kick off a discussion by [opening an issue on the FAST component GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/issues).
