Fluent UI Web Components and Ember work great together.

## Setting up the Ember project

First, you'll need to make sure that you have Node.js installed. You can learn more and download that [on the official site](https://nodejs.org/).

With Node.js installed, you can run the following command to install the Ember CLI:

```shell
npm install -g ember-cli
```

With the CLI installed, you have access to the `ember` command-line interface. This can be used to create a new Ember project. For example, to create a new Ember App named "fluent-ember", you would use the following command:

```shell
ember new fluent-ember --lang en
```

When the CLI completes, you should have a basic runnable Ember application.

## Configuring packages

Next, we'll install the Fluent UI Web Component packages, along with supporting libraries. To do that, run this command from your new project folder:

```shell
npm install --save @fluentui/web-components @microsoft/fast-element lodash-es
```

## Using the components

With all the pieces in place, let's run our app in dev mode with `npm start`. The Ember CLI should build your project and make it available on localhost. Right now, it displays a basic welcome message, since we haven't added any code or interesting HTML. Let's change that.

First, open your `app/app.js` file and add the following code:

```ts
import { provideFluentDesignSystem, fluentCard, fluentButton, fluentTextField } from '@fluentui/web-components';

provideFluentDesignSystem().register(fluentCard(), fluentButton(), fluentTextField());
```

This code uses the Fluent Design System to register the `<fluent-card>`, `<fluent-button>`, and `<fluent-text-field>` components. Once you save, the dev server will rebuild and refresh your browser. However, you still won't see anything. Open your `application.hbs` file and replace the `<WelcomePage />` component with the following HTML and then save again.

```html
    <h2>Fluent Ember</h2>
    <fluent-text-field placeholder="Enter Some Text"></fluent-text-field>
    <fluent-button appearance="accent">Click Me</fluent-button>
  </fluent-card>
```

Now you should see the Fluent UI Web Components displayed in your Ember application.

Next, let's improve this by refactoring it into a component. Stop the CLI and run the following command to scaffold a new Ember component that will be called `fluent-demo`.

```ts
ember generate component fluent-demo
```

Copy your original HTML above and use it to replace the HTML in your `app/components/fluent-demo.hbs` file. Next replace that same HTML in `templates/application.hbs` file with the following Ember component use:

```html
<FluentDemo />
```

Run `npm start` again and you should see the same output, but now we have moved our web components into a `fluentDemo` Ember component.

Let's take it a little further. Create a `fluent-demo.js` file in the same folder as your `fluent-demo.hbs` file and paste the following code:

```js
import Component from '@glimmer/component';
import { action } from '@ember/object';
import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';

export default class FluentDemoComponent extends Component {
  @tracked exampleTextField = '';

  @action
  onClick() {
    console.log(this.exampleTextField);
  }

  @action
  onInput(event) {
    this.exampleTextField = event.target.value;
  }
}
```

Next, update the `fluent-demo.hbs` file with the following HTML:

```html
<fluent-card>
  <h2>fluent Ember</h2>
  <fluent-text-field placeholder="Enter Some Text"
                   value="{{this.exampleTextField}}"
                   {{on "input" this.onInput}}
  ></fluent-text-field>
  <fluent-button appearance="accent" {{on "click" this.onClick}}>Click Me</fluent-button>
</fluent-card>
```

With this code in place, you now have Fluent UI Web Components fully binding to data and handling user interactions, all from inside an Ember component.

Congratulations! You're now set up to use Fluent and Ember!
