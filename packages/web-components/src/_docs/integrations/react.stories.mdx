Fluent UI Web Components can be used in React applications. Let's take a look at how you can set up a project, starting from scratch.

## Setting up the React project

First, you'll need to make sure that you have Node.js >= 8.2 and npm >= 5.6 installed. You can learn more and download that [on the official site](https://nodejs.org/).

With Node.js installed, you can use [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) to create a new React project.

```shell
npx create-react-app fluent-app
```

## Configuring packages

Next, we'll install the Fluent UI Web Component package, along with supporting FAST libraries. To do that, run this command from your new project folder:

```shell
npm install --save @fluentui/web-components @microsoft/fast-foundation @microsoft/fast-element @microsoft/fast-react-wrapper
```

## Configure create-react-app

[create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app) ships with an [eslint](https://eslint.org/) rule that makes working with Fluent UI Web Components difficult. There are two changes that will need to be made in the `package.json`:

**Set the EXTEND_ESLINT environment variable in start, build, and test scripts**

```jsonc
{
  //...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "EXTEND_ESLINT=true react-scripts start",
    "build": "EXTEND_ESLINT=true react-scripts build",
    "test": "EXTEND_ESLINT=true react-scripts test"
  }
  // ...
}
```

**Override the `eslintConfig` field to turn off the 'no-unused-expressions' rule**

```jsonc
{
  //..
  "eslintConfig": {
    "extends": "react-app",
    "rules": {
      "no-unused-expressions": "off"
    }
  }
  //..
}
```

See [configuring eslint](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/setting-up-your-editor#experimental-extending-the-eslint-config) for more information.

## Using the components

With all the basic pieces in place, let's run our app in dev mode with `npm start`. Right now, it displays the React logo and some editing instructions, since we haven't added any code or interesting HTML. Let's change that.

First, open your `src/app.js` file and add the following code:

With all the basic pieces in place, let's run our app in dev mode with `npm start`. Right now, it displays the React logo and some editing instructions, since we haven't added any code or interesting HTML. Let's change that.

First, open your `src/app.js` file and add the following code:

```js
import { provideFluentDesignSystem, fluentCard, fluentButton } from '@fluentui/web-components';
import { provideReactWrapper } from '@microsoft/fast-react-wrapper';
import React from 'react';

const { wrap } = provideReactWrapper(React, provideFluentDesignSystem());

export const FluentCard = wrap(fluentCard());
export const FluentButton = wrap(fluentButton());
```

This code uses the Fluent Design System to register the `<fluent-card>` and `<fluent-button>` components while automatically wrapping them into React components. Once you save, the dev server will rebuild and refresh your browser. However, you still won't see anything. To get some UI showing up, we need to write some HTML that uses our components. Replace the App component in your `src/app.js` file with the following:

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <FluentCard>
      <h2>Fluent React</h2>
      <FluentButton appearance="accent" onClick={() => console.log('clicked')}>
        Click Me
      </FluentButton>
    </FluentCard>
  );
}
```

To add a splash of style, add the following to the `src/App.css`:

```css
fluent-card {
  padding: 16px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

h2 {
  font-size: var(--type-ramp-plus-5-font-size);
  line-height: var(--type-ramp-plus-5-line-height);
}

fluent-card > fluent-button {
  align-self: flex-end;
}
```

Congratulations! You're now set up to use Fluent and React!

## Using the React Wrapper

Above, we leveraged the `@microsoft/fast-react-wrapper` library to enable seamless integration of Fluent Components. There are a few additional ways to use this API for different web component scenarios.

### Wrapping Design System Components

Previously, you've seen that we can wrap a Design System component by passing its registration function to the `wrap` method as follows:

```ts
const { wrap } = provideReactWrapper(React, provideFluentDesignSystem());

export const FluentButton = wrap(fluentButton());
```

This code creates a wrapper that is configured with a React-compatible API and a Design System instance. When passing a Design System as the second parameter, you can then pass component registration functions to the `wrap` helper. The helper will both register the web component with the Design System and wrap it in a type-safe React component, all with a single call.

Alternatively, you can skip providing the Design System to the wrapper, and use the generated registry to manually register all previously wrapped components.

```ts
const { wrap, registry } = provideReactWrapper(React);

export const FluentButton = wrap(fluentButton());

provideFluentDesignSystem().register(registry);
```

The final option is to handle everything by hand:

```ts
const { wrap } = provideReactWrapper(React);

export const FluentButton = wrap(fluentButton());

provideFluentDesignSystem().register(fluentButton());
```

### Configuring Custom Events

If the wrapped component uses custom events that you intend to use from React, you will need to manually configure a mapping from React event name to the native event name. Here's an example of what that would look like if you wanted to leverage the FAST MenuItem's `expanded-change` event:

```ts
const { wrap } = provideReactWrapper(React, provideFluentDesignSystem());

export const FluentMenuItem = wrap(fluentMenuItem(), {
  events: {
    onExpandedChange: 'expanded-change',
  },
});
```

## Additional Notes

### create-react-app

FAST makes use of decorators to define components. At this time, `create-react-app` [does not support decorators](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/can-i-use-decorators/). This won't be a problem when using components _imported_ from FAST because they have already been transpiled by TypeScript - but to _create_ components in a `create-react-app` application you'll need to do one of the following:

- [Define components without decorators](https://fast.design/docs/fast-element/defining-elements#working-without-decorators)
- [Eject](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject)`create-react-app` and change Babel to support decorators
- Use an intermediary like [react-app-rewired](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-app-rewired)

### Data Binding

#### HTML Attributes

React is capable of rendering custom HTML elements and binding data to them, but it is beneficial to understand _how_ React does this. React will apply all _props_ to a custom HTML element as _HTML attributes_ - including non-primitive types such as arrays and objects. Where some UI libraries provide binding syntaxes to distinguish setting properties, attributes, and events, React does not. This means that it can be very easy to end up with `my-prop="[object Object]"` in your HTML. React is exploring solutions [in this issue](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11347). See the section on [interop layers](#interop-layers-skatejsval-and-reactify-wc) for a work-around for this issue.

#### Custom events

React's synthetic eventing system comes with an unfortunate side-effect of being incapable of declaratively applying [`CustomEvent`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent) listeners. [interop layers](#interop-layers-skatejsval-and-reactify-wc) can be used to address this issue. Alternatively, a `ref` can be used on the custom element to imperatively apply the event listener to the HTML element directly.

#### Interop layers: @skatejs/val and reactify-wc

[@skatejs/val](https://github.com/skatejs/val) is a small library that wraps React's `createElement` function and provides the ability direct React _props_ explicitly to HTML attributes, DOM properties, or to declarative event listeners.

Another good option is [reactify-wc](https://github.com/BBKolton/reactify-wc). It provides similar capabilities as `@skatejs/val` but does so by creating component wrappers.

### TypeScript and TSX support

If you're using TypeScript, you'll need to augment the `JSX.IntrinsicElements` interface to use custom elements in TSX. To do so, create a `custom-elements.d.ts` file in your source directory and add the following:

```ts
// custom-elements.d.ts
declare namespace JSX {
  interface IntrinsicElements {
    /**
     *  React.DetailedHTMLProps<React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>, HTMLElement> allows setting standard HTML attributes on the element
     */
    'my-element': React.DetailedHTMLProps<React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLElement>, HTMLElement> & {
      'my-attribute-name': string;
    };
  }
}
```
