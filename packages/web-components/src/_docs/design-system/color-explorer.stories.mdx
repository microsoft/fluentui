## Color Explorer

This tool illustrates how the Adaptive Color system works using recipes to evaluate colors relative to their background context.
All components are styled using these recipes and will adjust accordingly.

Note that while hex values are provided, they should not be used in code aside from specifying the base colors used to create each palette.
They may be used for legacy frameworks that don't support the color model to match the visuals from the web components.

export const temp = init();

<app-main neutral-color="#808080" accent-color="#0078D4"></app-main>
