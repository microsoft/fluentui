# Color Picker

This component has been forked from `@microsoft/fast-tooling` as the addition of the tooling dependency creates a circular dependency which was found while attempting to update shared dependencies. This folder can be safely removed once we are able to update the color picker's accessibility to a point where it can be added to the `@microsoft/fast-components` package. At that point in time, both the color explorer and `@microsoft/fast-tooling` would take a dependency on the core component.
