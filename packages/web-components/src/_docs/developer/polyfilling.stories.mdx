# Polyfilling

Fluent UI Web Components takes a "bring your own polyfill" approach so that projects can opt-in to polyfilling only when necessary. Features gracefully degrade whenever possible but some features might require a small shim to work in older browsers.

## Baseline

Here's a list of features we're leveraging and their current [Baseline](https://web.dev/baseline) browser support.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Chrome</th>
    <th>Edge</th>
    <th>Firefox</th>
    <th>Safari</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>HTML Popover Attribute</td>
    <td>114</td>
    <td>114</td>
    <td>125</td>
    <td>17</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CSS Anchor Positioning</td>
    <td>125</td>
    <td>125</td>
    <td>❌</td>
    <td>❌</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## HTML Popover

From Fluent UI Web Components V3 forward, popover-like components will make use of the newer [HTML popover attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/popover). Broader `[popover]` support beyond the browser baseline will require a polyfill.

To get started, add the [popover polyfill](https://github.com/oddbird/popover-polyfill/) to your package.

```bash
yarn install @oddbird/popover-polyfill
```

Then in your `main.js` file after your `setTheme()` call, check for `popover` support and lazily import the package if not supported.

```js
(async () => {
  if (!('popover' in HTMLElement.prototype)) {
    await import('@oddbird/popover-polyfill');
  }
})();
```

Two lines of global CSS are needed to cleanup a potential positioning side effect created by the polyfill and LightDOM authored child components.

```css
[popover].\:popover-open {
  inset: unset;
  border: 1px solid transparent;
}
```

## CSS Anchor Positioning

Menu anchor positioning is handled minimally in a fallback script but for more complex anchor positioned components (Tooltip, Dropdown, Combobox), you will need to implement your own polyfill.

```js
/**
 * Client-side Import example with conditional polyfill import for older browsers.
 * This MUST be included before Fluent UI.
 */
if (!CSS.supports('anchor-name: --foo')) {
  const { default: applyPolyfill } = await import(
    'https://unpkg.com/@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning/dist/css-anchor-positioning-fn.js'
  );
  window.CSS_ANCHOR_POLYFILL = applyPolyfill;
}
```

```js
/**
 * NPM Import example where polyfill is bundled into main bundle
 * This MUST be included before Fluent UI.
 */
import { default as applyPolyfill } from '@oddbird/css-anchor-positioning/fn';
window.CSS_ANCHOR_POLYFILL = applyPolyfill;
```
