# Button

The `Button` component allows users to commit a change or trigger an action via a single click or tap and is often found inside forms, dialogs, panels and/or pages.

## **Design Spec**

<br />

## **Engineering Spec**

Fluent WC3 Button has feature parity with the Fluent UI React 9 Button implementation but not direct parity.

<br />

## Class: `Button`

<br />

### **Component Name**

`<fluent-button></fluent-button>`

<br />

## **Preparation**

<br />

### **Fluent Web Component v3 v.s Fluent React 9**

<br />

**Component and Slot Mapping**

| Fluent UI React 9 | Fluent Web Components 3 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| `<Button>`        | `<fluent-button>`       |

<br />

**Property Mapping**
| Fluent UI React 9 | Fluent Web Components 3 | Description of difference |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `icon`is a slot | The default slot or `start`, and `end` | In FUIR9, `icon` is a slot. In the web components implementation, an icon can be passed into the default slot and paired with an `icon-only` attribute, or supplementally in the `start` and/or `end` slots |
| `defaultValue` | `current-value` | In React, `defaultValue` sets the default value of form controls. In HTML, `value` is the default value, it doesn't update. [This RFC](https://github.com/microsoft/fast/issues/5119) provides more detail on how we came to decide to go with `current-value` instead of alternatives. Ultimately, the decision stems on staying aligned to the web platform as deviating would likely mean deviation for good. |
| `as` | A separate web component for anchor implementations | In FUIR9, HTML is returned so interpolating tags in the virtual DOM doesn't present a problem. In WC's, we can't safely interpolate tags and the cost to provide two sets of API's, one form associated and one not`icon` is a slot. In the web components implementation, conditional rendering brings with it a cost as both templates need to be enumerated. Additionally, button is a form associated element whereas anchors are not. For this reason, we'll provide an "anchor-button" as a separate component. |
