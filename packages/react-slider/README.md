# @fluentui/react-slider

**React Slider components for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**

The Slider component allows users to quickly select a value (or range) by dragging an icon across a bar. It is often used when setting
values with a relaxed precision such as audio volume and screen brightness.

## STATUS: WIP ðŸš§

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

## Usage

To import Slider:

```js
import { Slider } from '@fluentui/react-slider';
```

Once the Slider component graduates to a production release, the component will be available at:

```js
import { Slider } from '@fluentui/slider';
```
