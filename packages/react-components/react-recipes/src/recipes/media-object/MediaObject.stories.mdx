# Media Object recipe

### **Overview**

A Media Object, is a pattern that is commonly used to display some media content and a description of that content.
It is commonly used to display an Avatar/Image of a person along with their name and description. We provide an
out of the box component in Fluent UI (v8's Persona and v9's Persona) that can be used to achieve this pattern.

This recipe focuses on the other uses of this pattern, where media content is not a persona. We will guide you on
how to create a Media Object that can be used to display images, icons, and any other media content you might
want to add.

- <LinkTo kind="components-image--default">@fluentui/react-image</LinkTo>
- <LinkTo kind="components-text--default">@fluentui/react-text</LinkTo>

> **\*\*Note:\*\*** This recipe is meant to provide a way to use custom media. If you want to use
> `Avatar` or `PresenceBadge` as media, please refer to our Persona Component.

## **Steps**

There are two ways to build a Media Object, you can use a grid layout or a flex layout. We will cover both in this
recipe. There are upsides and downsides to both, but the main difference is that grid layout uses less dom than the
flex option.

### **Flex Layout**

The main idea behind the flex layout is to have a container and two children, as shown below. The parent div will
contain the media and another div (text div) that will contain the text content.

<Example centered>
  <FlexSkeleton />
</Example>

To achieve this layout, the parent and text div need to have `display: flex`. The text div should have a
`flex-direction: column` to stack the text lines vertically. After these steps we can achieve something like this:

<Example centered>
  <IconMediaObject />
</Example>

### **Grid Layout**

When using a grid for Media Object, we only need a parent div and we can input the items directly into it.

> As you can see, the grid layout has one less layer of dom compared to the flex layout. This is especially important
> when the component is going to be used in a list or the items have many layers themselves.

To get the initial layout, we need to set the parent to `display: grid`, `grid-auto-flow: column` and the media to `grid-row-start: span 2`.
There are many ways to achieve a Media Object with grid, but this is the simplest one. One caveat is that
you need to know how many lines of text you will have to set the `grid-row-start` correctly.

If these lines of text are applied dynamically, you can use `grid-template-columns` with a separator to achieve the
same result.

After these steps, we will be left with something like the example shown in the beginning.

## **Variants**

There are a few common variants that you might want to use when building a Media Object. These are some of them:

- ### **Text Alignment Variations**

There are text alignment variations that might be useful when building an application. These can be ones below where the
first one is after the media, the second one is below, and the last one is before.

<Example centered>
  <TextPositionVariations />
</Example>

- ### **Text Vertical Alignment Variations**

There are also vertical alignment variations, these include start and center as seen below.

<Example centered>
  <TextAlignmentVariations />
</Example>

## **Best practices**

- The higher up the text line, the more important it is. You should not apply higher weights to the lines underneath.
- When using `grid-template-columns` make sure the dom makes sense and not differ from how the grid is placing them.
