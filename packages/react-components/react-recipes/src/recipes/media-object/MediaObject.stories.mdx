## Media Object recipe

### **Overview**

<!--
Add a description of the recipe here. This should be a short description and what it does.
-->

A Media Object, is a pattern that is commonly used to display some media content and a description of that content.
It is commonly used to display an Avatar/Image of a person along with their name and description. We provide an
out of the box component in Fluent UI (v8's Persona and v9's Persona) that can be used to achieve this pattern.

This recipe focuses on the other uses of this pattern, where media content is not a persona. We will guide you on
how to create a Media Object that can be used to display images, icons, and any other media content you might
want to add.
