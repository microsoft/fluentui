## Best practices

### Do

- Use an `indeterminate` Progress when the total units to completion is unknown
- Display operation description
- Show text above and/or below the bar
- Combine steps of a single operation into one bar

### Don't

- Use only a single word description
- Show text to the right or left of the bar
- Cause progress to "rewind" to show new steps
