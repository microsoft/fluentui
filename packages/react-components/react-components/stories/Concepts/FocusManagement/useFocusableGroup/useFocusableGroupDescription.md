This hook applies specific focus behaviour for focusable elements that contain other nested focusable elements.
Developers can choose betwen different strategies on how focus should be moved into nested focusable elements.

> ⚠️ Nested focusable elements are not standard, and are generally considered to be an anti-pattern. Please clarify
> with your accessibility champ to make sure that your feature warrants using nested focusable elements since there
> is no easy way to define how they should behave.
