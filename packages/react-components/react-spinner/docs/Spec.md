# @fluentui/react-spinner Spec

## Background

A Spinner is an outline of a circle which animates around itself indicating to the user that things are processing. Spinner is typically an indeterminate ProgressIndicator that is used when it is unknown how long a task will take to complete. They can be various sizes, located inline with content or centered. They generally appear while an action is being processed or committed. They are subtle and generally do not take up much space, but are transitions from the completed task.

### Comparison of v8 and v0

The existing components are:

- v8
  - `Spinner`
- v0
  - `Loader`
- Both `Spinner` and `Loader` have very similar props
- `Loader` has `delay`, while `Spinner` has aria props exposed for accessibility.

## Sample Code

Basic examples:

```jsx=
import { Spinner } from "@fluentui/react-spinner";

function App() {
    return (
        <Spinner size="medium" label="Loading" />
    )
}

```

## Variants

- Indeterminate Spinner
  - The default Spinner that spins around indefinitely

### Shape

The Spinner is represented as a circle with an arc of a darker shade rotating the circumfrence

## API

### Slots

- `root` - The root element of the Spinner. The html element is a `span`
- `loader` - The svg element that gets animated into a Spinner. The html element is `svg`
- `label` - The text shown with the Spinner. This uses the `Text` control

### Props

See API at [Spinner.types.tsx](./src/components/Spinner/Spinner.types.ts).

## Structure

```html
<span class="fui-Spinner">
  <!-- Label for Spinner -->
  <span className="fui-Spinner__label">Loading...</span>
  <span className="fui-Spinner__spinner">
    <!-- Svg that receives the animation. Classnames are used for animation -->
    <svg role="progressbar" className="fui-Spinner__Progressbar">
      <circle className="fui-Spinner__Track" />
      <circle className="fui-Spinner__Tail" />
    </svg>
  </span>
</span>
```

## Migration

See [MIGRATION.md](./MIGRATION.md).

## Behaviors

### States

- **Display** - The Spinner will use the following priority:

  - Adding the `inverted` will alter the way that the Spinner is displayed.

### Interaction

The Spinner is non-interactive.

- **Keyboard** - Not keyboard focusable.
- **Mouse**

  - Click: No action

- **Touch** - Nothing

## Accessibility

When reduced motion, is active the `indeterminate` `Spinner` will rotate once and then stop animating.
