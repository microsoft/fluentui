### Do

- If your Spinner is the only element on the page, set tabIndex={0} on it to allow it to be picked up by screen readers.

- Use one Spinner at a time.
- Descriptive verbs are appropriate under a Spinner to help the user understand what's happening. Ie: Saving, processing, updating.
- Use a Spinner when confirming a change has been made or a task is being processed.
- Add a description to a Spinner when reduced-motion is active

### Don't

- Donâ€™t use a Spinner when performing immediate tasks.
