A `TagPicker` combines a text field and a dropdown giving people a way to select an option from a list or enter their own choice. It is a specialized version of a [`Combobox`](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/components-combobox--default) where selecting an option from a list results in a [`Tag`](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/components-tag-tag--default) being added close to the text field.
