# What are v9's breaking changes?

There are several paradigm shifts necessary to achieve the improvements in v9 that cause breaking changes.

## Props vs. Children

**v8** - components often take data props like items and then internally use a map function to render the children.

**v9** - components have JSX child elmements so the caller can compose children however they like from data.

## Custom Styling

**v8**

- styles props allow styles to be both generated and applied at runtime; this significantly affected render performance.
- Custom styles are javascript objects passed to the `styles` attribute
- CSS-in-JS styles are combined with mergeStyles within components.

**v9**

- styles are determined ahead of time, then applied at runtime based on props or state. Instead of parameterized style values, v9 leverages CSS variables.
- v9 styles can be optimized at build time so different classes can be efficiently merged and applied.

- CSS-in-JS styles are created with makeStyles and combined with mergeClasses. There are some constraints to support build-time CSS bunding and optimization.
- Custom styling is applied through the `className` attribute on the component (or any slot)

## Theming

**v8**

- The ThemeProvider component provides a contextual theme object.
- The theme is a collection of component styles, color palettes, fonts, and spacing.
- Components consume the theme through the theme object in state or the useTheme hook.
- Deprecated loadTheme and theme customizer support legacy themes.

**v9**

- The FluentProvider provides a contextual theme using css variables.
- The theme is a collection of design tokens. There are global tokens for colors and sizes. There are alias tokens for general purpose component parts (e.g. background, border);
- Components consume the theme through CSS variables. A tokens object provides access to the variables.

## Render Customization

**v8** - Rendering is customized through render props callback provided by individual components.

**v9** - Components provide slots that allow replacement of specific parts.
