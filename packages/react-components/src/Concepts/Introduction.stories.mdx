<h2 className="fluent">Overview</h2>
<div className="fluent-text">

Fluent UI vNext is a set of UI components and utilities resulting from an effort to converge the set of React based component libraries in production today: `@fluentui/react` and `@fluentui/react-northstar`.

Each component is designed to adhere to the following standards:

- Customizable: Fluent-styled components by default, but easy to integrate your own brand and theme​
- Performance: Optimized for render performance​
- Bundle size: Refactored and slimmed down components​ that allow you to include the packages and dependencies you need
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliant and tested by trusted testers
- Design to Code: Stay up to date with Fluent Design Language changes via Design Tokens
