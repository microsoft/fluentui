## Creating an accessible web application or web page

When designing an application or a web page, keep in mind that the easiest way to make it accessible is to maintain a consistent and compliant document structure.
The following steps help to design an accessible user experience:

- Decompose UI to parts and **identify components, variants and behaviors to use**
- define the usage of **[headings and landmarks](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/examples/landmarks/index.html)**
- verify the usage of **[color and contrast](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)** to convey information
- ensure **tab order and arrow key navigation** is consistent with DOM structure and ARIA roles
- specify **labels**, especially for components without textual information (e.g. icon only buttons) and for containers (lists, toolbars and so on)
- specify texts for **state change announcements** (error messages, confirmations, dynamic UI changes, ...)
- identify UI parts that **appear on hover or focus** then specify keyboard and screen reader interaction with them. Keep in mind that screen readers and in most cases also touch devices do not support hover state.
- list cases when **focus** needs to be **moved programmatically** (if parts of the UI are appearing/disappearing or other cases)
- list cases when **focus** needs to be **trapped** in sections of the UI (for dialogs, popups or hierarchical navigation)
- when extending existing functionality, think about how it fits into the current experience with regards to **discoverability, interaction, keyboard navigation and screen reader navigation**
- in your designs, cover **High contrast** and **Zoom** scenarios
