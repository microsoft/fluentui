# Alpha Components

## About alpha controls

❗ These component are available for limited production use, but their APIs may change before final release as functionality is still being added. ❗

## Usage

Alpha components are published in `@fluentui/react-components` but are only accessible under the `unstable` path.

```tsx
import { AlphaComponentName } from '@fluentui/react-components/unstable';
```

When the component graduates out of alpha state you will need to start importing it from the package root.
