This walkthrough will show how to create a carousel with text and photo transitions, using motion components and choreography.

- We start with simple static text and images.
- We add transitions by wrapping these elements in motion components.
- We choreograph the transitions with the `Series` and `Stagger` components.

The result is a carousel that transitions between two photo arrangements, similar to this [MotionSpec](https://app.motionspec.io/dev/6aRuSNqtHa9dKJAlholc).
