# @fluentui/react-select

**React Select components for [Fluent UI React](https://react.fluentui.dev)**

The Select component provides a styled wrapper around the native `<select>` element. It is recommended over Combobox when features like filtering and virtualization are not required. It provides better cross-platform functionality particularly on mobile, and better accessibility.
