# @fluentui/react-select

**React Select components for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**

The Select component provides a styled wrapper around the native `<select>` element. It is recommended over Combobox when features like filtering and virtualization are not required. It provides better cross-platform functionality particularly on mobile, and better accessibility.

## STATUS: WIP 🚧

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.
