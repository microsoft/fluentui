## Best practices

### Do

- Ensure each component has clear, concise labels to help users understand their functions.
- Update the display of the selected color in real-time as users interact with the sliders or input fields to provide immediate feedback.
- Implement input validation for HEX and RGB text fields to ensure users enter valid formats. Provide clear error messages for invalid entries.
- Allow Keyboard Input.
- Ensure that color selections can be made and visualized without reliance on color alone. Use labels, indicators, and tooltips to assist users with visual impairments.

### Don't

- Ensure consistency in color formats used throughout the ColorPicker. Avoid confusing users by mixing different formats without clear explanation.
