V9 TimePicker should be used together with `Field` component, and it provides more flexibility for custom validation.

- You can perform custom parsing and validation for freeform input using `formatDateToTimeString`.
- Validation of the selected time option from the dropdown can be achieved by validating the `selectedTime` within `onTimeChange` callback.
