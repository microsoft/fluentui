`TimePicker` offers a control thatâ€™s optimized for selecting a time from a drop-down list or using free-form input to enter a custom time.

Note: TimePicker is a compat component - its internal architecture does not follow all the principles regular Fluent UI v9 components follow - it is not composed of atomic hooks and it might be more difficult to tweak its appearance and behavior. It however follows Fluent 2 design and uses design tokens, it is production ready and it is stable.
