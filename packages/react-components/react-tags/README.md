# @fluentui/react-tags

**React Tags components for [Fluent UI React](https://react.fluentui.dev/)**

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

A tag is a representation of an attribute, person, or asset that someone has picked, like recipients for an email or categories on a planner task.

Use a tag when thereâ€™s no available interaction.
Use an interaction tag when people can interact for more information or actions related to what the tag represents.
