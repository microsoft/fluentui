/**
 * A palette is represented as a continuous curve through LAB space, made of two quadratic bezier curves that start at
 * 0L (black) and 100L (white) and meet at the LAB value of the provided key color.
 *
 * This function takes in a palette as input, which consists of:
 * keyColor:        The primary color in the LCH (Lightness Chroma Hue) color space
 * darkCp, lightCp: The control point of the quadratic beizer curve towards black and white, respectively (between 0-1).
 *                  Higher values move the control point toward the ends of the gamut causing chroma/saturation to
 *                  diminish more slowly near the key color, and lower values move the control point toward the key
 *                  color causing chroma/saturation to diminish more linearly.
 * hueTorsion:      Enables the palette to move through different hues by rotating the curveâ€™s points in LAB space,
 *                  creating a helical curve

 * The function returns a set of brand tokens.
