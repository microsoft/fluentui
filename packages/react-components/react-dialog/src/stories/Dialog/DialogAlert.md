An `alert` Dialog is a modal dialog that interrupts the user's workflow to communicate an important message and acquire a response. Examples include action confirmation prompts and error message confirmations. The `alert` Dialog role enables assistive technologies and browsers to distinguish alert dialogs from other dialogs so they have the option of giving alert dialogs special treatment, such as playing a system alert sound.

By default clicking on `backdrop` and pressing `Escape` will not dismiss an `alert` Dialog.
