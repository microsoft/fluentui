Accessibility edge cases scenarios
</summary>

Here are some accessibility edge cases scenarios we identified and users should keep in mind while using the `Dialog` components.

1. NVDA reads dialog information twice
2. Talkback doesn't support dialog name/description
3. Talkback doesn't support `alertdialog`
4. Whenever including a `Menu`, `Combobox`, `Dropdown` or `Popover` inside a dialog the property `aria-modal` should be false otherwise VoiceOver on IOS will not be able to access the popup.
5. `DialogSurface` by default has `aria-describedby="dialog-content-id"`, which might not be ideal with complex `DialogContent`, on those scenarios (for example on [with form](#with-form)), it is recommended to set `aria-describedby={undefined}`
