A `non-modal` Dialog by default presents no `backdrop`, allowing elements outside of the Dialog to be interacted with.

`DialogTitle` compound component will present by default a `closeButton`.

> Note: if an element outside of the dialog is focused then it will not be possible to close the dialog with the `Escape` key.
