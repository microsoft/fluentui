A tracker hook, that monitors the state of animations and transitions for a particular element. This hook does not directly create animations but instead synchronizes with CSS properties to determine the rendering status, visibility, entering, leaving, and ongoing animation of a component. By default, if any CSS changes or properties are overridden, this hook will automatically adjust and stay synchronized.
