# @fluentui/react-virtualizer

**This package has been deprecated and moved to the [Fluent UI contributor repo](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui-contrib/tree/main/packages/react-virtualizer) for stable release**

**Virtualizer components for [Fluent UI React](https://react.fluentui.dev/)**

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.
