# @fluentui/react-card Spec

## Background

A card's main function is to provide the scaffolding for hosting actions and content for a single topic within a card sized object. It is a framework for organizing content within the confines of a card.

The card itself should not have content or actions built in, but provide the mechanisms for it to be displayed.

### Fabric (v8)

Example:

```jsx
<DocumentCard
  aria-label="Default Document Card with large file name. Created by Annie Lindqvist a few minutes ago."
  onClickHref="http://bing.com"
>
  <DocumentCardPreview {...previewProps} />
  <DocumentCardTitle title="Filename" />
  <DocumentCardActivity activity="Created a few minutes ago" people={DocumentCardActivityPeople} />
</DocumentCard>
```

### Northstar (v0)

```jsx
<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <Flex gap="gap.small">
      <Avatar
        image="https://fabricweb.azureedge.net/fabric-website/assets/images/avatar/RobertTolbert.jpg"
        label="Forward Division Analyst"
        name="Lura Hermiston"
        status="unknown"
      />
      <Flex column>
        <Text content="Lura Hermiston" weight="bold" />
        <Text content="Forward Division Analyst" size="small" />
      </Flex>
    </Flex>
  </CardHeader>
  <CardBody>Sit quaerat dolorem quos sit et dolorem asperiores.</CardBody>
</Card>
```

## Prior Art

- [Open UI research](https://github.com/openui/open-ui/pull/134)
- [Convergence epic](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues/19336)

## Comparison of [Fabric DocumentCard](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/documentcard) and [Northstar Card](https://fluentsite.z22.web.core.windows.net/0.57.0/components/card/definition)

Fabric's DocumentCard seems tied to a specific format, Office focused, while Northstar's Card is more generic.
DocumentCard has components for each specific need of a card that displays documents as it offers image previews/file lists, user activity and other related things.
Card goes for a more structural and generic approach to a card component and is closer to the vision for the v9 Card.

#### `scale` property

- `fixed`: Size of the card is fixed.
- `auto-width`: `width` is set to `fit-content`.
- `auto-height`: `height` is set to `fit-content`.
- `auto`: `width` and `height` are set to `fit-content`.
- `fluid-width`: `width` is set to `100%`.
- `fluid-height`: `height` is set to `100%`.
- `fluid`: `width` and `height` are set to `100%`.

#### `focusMode` property

The three allowed focus behaviours (`no-tab`, `tab-exit`, `tab-only`) map to the behaviors provided by Tabster.

- `off`

  The card will not focusable.

- `no-tab` (`trapFocus` in Tabster)

  This behaviour traps the focus inside of the Card when pressing the `Enter` key and will only release focus when pressing the `Escape` key.

- `tab-exit` (`limited` in Tabster)

  This behaviour traps the focus inside of the Card when pressing the `Enter` key but will release focus when pressing the `Tab` key on the last inner element.

- `tab-only` (`unlimited` in Tabster)

  This behaviour will cycle through all elements inside of the Card when pressing the `Tab` key and then release focus after the last inner element.

#### Context menu

Context menu should be handled in conjunction with the @fluentui/react-menu component. A simple usage example would be:

```jsx
<Menu openOnContext>
  <MenuTrigger>
    <Card />
  </MenuTrigger>

  <MenuPopover>
    <MenuList>
      <MenuItem>Share</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>Dismiss</MenuItem>
    </MenuList>
  </MenuPopover>
</Menu>
```

`react-card` documentation will contain more elaborate examples to cover the different use cases.

## Behaviours

### Mouse

### Interactive cards

![Visual interaction of interactive cards using the mouse](./assets/interactive-interaction-mouse.png)

The card surface can be used as a clickable target

1. Rest

2. OnHover

   Cursor style changes to pointer, background color & elevation values change to show card is an actionable element

3. OnClick

   Executes action assigned to card i.e. “Open file, Open link in browser etc...”

### Non-interactive cards with interactive child components

![Visual interaction of non-interactive cards using the mouse](./assets/non-interactive-interaction-mouse.png)

Cards that have multiple actions within them cannot be clickable. We preserve the use of `EnterKey` for moving focus to actionable controls inside the card.

1. OnMouseEnter / Hover

   Cursor style stays at default, rest state stays persistent no visual feedback is applied to the card surface

2. Hover & onClick

   Hover state only applies to actionable items within card i.e. buttons, links etc. Cursor changes to pointer (or follows behavior of that component) ”

#### Selectable cards

![Visual interaction of selectable cards using the mouse](./assets/selectable-interaction-mouse.png)

Clicking the card surface can toggle the checkbox state to `selected`. Note that checkboxes are composed together as an additional component and are not provided by default.

1. Rest

   Default state is `unselected`

2. Hover

   Cursor style changes to `pointer`, background color and elevation follows interactive styling to show visual feedback.

3. Pressed

   Cursor does not change background color and elevation follows interactive styling to show visual feedback for pressed state.

4. onClick

   Card and Checkbox are both in selected state, clicking again toggles components to unselected state.

### Non-interactive selectable cards

![Visual interaction of non-interactive selectable cards using the mouse](./assets/non-interactive-selectable-interaction-mouse.png)

Cards that have multiple actionable child components are expected to not be clickable. We preserve the use of `EnterKey` for moving focus to actionable controls inside the card, therefore the card surface should not be used to set the state of the card but is reliant on the checkbox or similar inputs to set the card state.

If users have a scenario that requires them to use actionable components within a clickable Card then the bubbling of events is expected to be managed by the users themselves.

If users have a scenario that requires them to use actionable components within a clickable Card then the bubbling of events is expected to be managed by the users themselves.

- OnMouseEnter / Hover

  Cursor style stays at default, rest state stays persistent no visual feedback is applied to the card surface

- Hover & onClick (Checkbox)

  Hover state & pressed state applies to checkbox component

- onClick (Checkbox)

  Card and Checkbox are both in selected state, clicking again toggles components to unselected state

#### Disabled

![Visual interaction of Disabled cards using the mouse](./assets/disabled.png)

In scenarios where a selectable card may be disabled both the card and the checkbox should be set to disabled.
Hovering the card changes the cursor style to not-allowed

1. Unselected disabled

   - Label: Selectable Card
   - Role: Group
   - State: Disabled, unselected

2. Selected disabled

   - Label: Selectable Card
   - Role: Group
   - State: Disabled, selected

### Keyboard

### Interactive cards

![Visual interaction of interactive cards using the keyboard](./assets/interactive-interaction-keyboard.png)

1. Rest

2. Keyboard interaction

   `EnterKey` Perfoms action on card “Open file, Open link in browser etc...”.

### Non-interactive cards with interactive child components

![Visual interaction of interactive cards using the keyboard](./assets/non-interactive-interaction-keyboard.png)

1. Focus

   Initial focus is set on card, to access items within the card use `EnterKey` or `Spacebar`.

2. Focus-Inside

   Focus moves to first actionable item in the card. Use `ArrowKeys` or `TabKey` to move focus to child elements within the card. To exit card use `EscKey`, to move focus back to card.

#### Selectable cards

![Visual interaction of selectable cards using the keyboard](./assets/selectable-interaction-keyboard.png)

1. Rest

   Default state is ‘unselected’

2. Focus

   Focus rectangle is shown on card

3. Focus

   Use spacebar to toggle state (selected/unselected)

### Non-interactive selectable cards

![Visual interaction of non-interactive selectable cards using the keyboard](./assets/non-interactive-selectable-interaction-keyboard.png)

1. Focus

   Initial focus is set on card, to access items within the card use `EnterKey` or `Spacebar`.

2. Focus-Inside

   Focus moves to first actionable item in the card. Use `ArrowKeys` or `TabKey` to move focus to child elements within the card. To exit card use `EscKey`, to move focus back to card.

3. Checkbox-Focus

   Depending on your tab order of items within the card, the number of keystrokes will vary.

4. `SpaceBar` or `EnterKey` while focused on the Checkbox

   Will toggle both Card and Checkbox to selected state. Keying again will toggle to unselected.

### Disabled

If a card is in a disabled state it should not receive focus from the tab order. And navigation to actionable child elements within the card should not be possible.

## Accessibility

> ⚠️ Note: All other accessibility information, not covered in this section, is provided throughout the spec.

Each card is of `role="group"`.
