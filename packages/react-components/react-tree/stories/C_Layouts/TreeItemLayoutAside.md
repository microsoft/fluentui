The `Tree` component allows for `aside` content to be provided through the `TreeItemAside` component to be added side by side with `TreeItemLayout` or `TreeItemPersonaLayout` layout components. This creates an area on the right side of the `TreeItem` where additional information can be displayed, such as a badge with notification count or an icon indicating importance. When actions are specified using the `actions` property of `TreeItemAside`, they will overlay the `aside` area on hover.

> ⚠️ Aside content is `aria-hidden` by default
