The `TreeItem` component allows for flexible display of items in a tree structure by supporting two types of layouts: `TreeItemLayout` and `TreeItemPersonaLayout`.

The `TreeItemLayout` component is designed to provide a consistent and functional structure for displaying a tree item. It defines the content and layout of the item in a simple and straightforward manner. This layout is ideal for displaying information about items that do not require additional visual elements, such as files or folders in a file system.

On the other hand, the `TreeItemPersonaLayout` component provides a more visually appealing representation of a tree item by including a media element, typically an avatar, alongside a description. This layout is perfect for displaying lists of people or topics, where the media element can represent an individual or a topic icon. As with `TreeItemLayout`, `TreeItemPersonaLayout` should only be used as a direct child of `TreeItem`.
