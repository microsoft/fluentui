To add or remove items from a `Tree` structure, you can use a function that modifies the data structure and updates the state. For example, to add a new item to the tree, you can create a new object with the appropriate properties and insert it into the array of items at the desired location. To remove an item, you can filter out the object with the corresponding ID and update the state with the filtered array.

Once the data structure is modified, the tree component will automatically re-render with the updated items. You can use this technique to add or remove items from the tree as needed.

It's important to ensure that the modifications to the tree structure preserve the correct levels and relationships between parent and child items. This can be done by carefully setting the parentId property for new items and updating the subtree property for parent items when children are added or removed.
