To add or remove items from a `Tree` structure, you can use a function that modifies the data structure and updates the state.

It's important to ensure that the modifications to the tree structure preserve the correct levels and relationships between parent and child items. This can be done by carefully setting the `parentId` property for new items and updating the subtree property for parent items when children are added or removed.
