In this single selection `Tree` example, the `TreeItem` and `useFlatTree_unstable` hook convert a flat array of items into a hierarchical tree. The `selectionMode` prop, set to `single`, activates selection functionality, allowing only one item to be active at a time. Optional props such as `defaultCheckedItems` and `checkedItems` offer extended control over the selection process. The tree also supports specifying items to be open upon initial render, ensuring a user-friendly navigation experience.
