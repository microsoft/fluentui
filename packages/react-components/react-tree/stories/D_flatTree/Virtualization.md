A `Tree` can be virtualized to optimize the rendering of a large tree structure. This technique involves creating a virtual version of the tree that only loads the visible nodes at any given time. By doing so, it reduces the number of DOM nodes that need to be rendered, which in turn improves time to interaction of large trees.

To achieve this, one can create a `flattened` version of the tree structure that can be easily consumed by a virtualization library. This library renders only the items that are currently visible on the screen, which improves TTI metrics.
