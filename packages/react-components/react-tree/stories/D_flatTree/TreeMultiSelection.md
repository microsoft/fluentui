In this multi-selection `Tree` example, the `TreeItem` and `useFlatTree_unstable` hook build upon the same principles as the single selection example but enable the selection of multiple items at once. This is achieved by setting the `selectionMode` prop to `multiselect`, enhancing user interactivity when multiple choices are required. Optional props `defaultCheckedItems` and `checkedItems` can further refine selection control.
