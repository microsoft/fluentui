In this lazy-loading hierarchical `Tree` structure example, the `LazyTreeItem` component and `useFlatTree` hook are utilized to create an efficient and dynamic tree. The tree loads and displays data on-demand, improving initial rendering time and performance. The `LazyTreeItem` component handles loading states and tree structure updates upon clicking a tree item. The `useFlatTree` hook converts the flat array of items into a tree structure, and allows control over individual `TreeItem` components' open/closed states using the `openItems` and `onOpenChange` props.
