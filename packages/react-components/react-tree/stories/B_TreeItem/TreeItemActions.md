Add custom actions to each `TreeItem` component to add extra functionality, such as buttons or menus. This can be done by passing a component that renders the desired actions as a prop to the `TreeItem`.

The `actions` are hidden by default and appear on the right-side when the user hovers over the `TreeItem`.
