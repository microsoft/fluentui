The `Tree` component allows each `TreeItem` to be displayed with a persona layout, which supports a `media` prop such as an `Avatar`.

The `Avatar` component can be customized with different sizes and shapes to suit the design needs. Nested Tree components can also contain `TreeItem` components with `TreeItemPersonaLayout` components with different media components. This layout provides a visually appealing representation of hierarchical data.
