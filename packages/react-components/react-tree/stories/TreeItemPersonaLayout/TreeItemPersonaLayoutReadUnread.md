The `Tree` component can be customized with different styles to make it more visually appealing. In the example below, the `TreeItemPersonaLayout` component is used to display messages with a `description` and an `Avatar` as the `media` prop.

The `description` prop is used to provide a secondary text content that can be customized with styles. In this case, the unread class from the `makeStyles` hook is applied to the div element to make the text appear `bold` for unread messages.
