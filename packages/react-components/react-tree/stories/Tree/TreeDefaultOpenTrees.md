The `Tree` component allows you to set the default open/closed state using the `defaultOpenItems` prop for expandable `TreeItem` components. This prop takes an array of `TreeItem` IDs that should be open by default. When the `Tree` is first rendered, the `TreeItem` components listed in `defaultOpenItems` will be open by default, while all other expandable `TreeItem` components will be closed.
