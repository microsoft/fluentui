`Tree` is a hierarchical structure for displaying data in a collapsible and expandable way. It consists of a root node that branches out to child nodes, which can also have their own child nodes. Each node can have a content, which is displayed in the tree. The tree is usually used to represent a hierarchy of information, such as a file system, or organization chart. Users can interact with the tree by expanding or collapsing nodes, selecting nodes, or performing actions.
