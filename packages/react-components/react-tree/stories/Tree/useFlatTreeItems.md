`useFlatTreeItems` is a React hook that creates a flattened tree structure from an array of nodes. It returns an object with properties and methods to interact with the flattened tree, including methods to get the props for rendering a Tree component and to iterate over the nodes in the flattened tree. This example uses the hook to create a flattened tree structure from an array of default nodes, and renders the tree using the `Tree` and `TreeItem` components.
