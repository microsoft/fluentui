This example demonstrates how to create a hierarchical tree structure using the `useFlatTree` hook and a flat array of tree items. Each item in the array represents a node in the tree, with properties such as `id`, `parentId`, and `children`. The `parentId` property indicates the hierarchical relationship between items in the tree. The `useFlatTree` hook converts the flat array into a tree structure, making it easier to render and manage.
