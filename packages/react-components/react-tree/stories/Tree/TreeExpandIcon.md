By default, `Tree` component comes with default expand/collapse icons. However, if you wish to customize the icons, you can use the `expandIcon` property provided by the `TreeItem` component.

To do this, you need to specify the `expandIcon` property for each expandable/collapsible `TreeItem`. The value of the expandIcon property can be any valid React component, which will be rendered in place of the default expand/collapse icon.
