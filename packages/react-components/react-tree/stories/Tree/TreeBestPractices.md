 Best Practices
</summary>

### Do

- Use the `Tree` component to create a tree structure with `TreeItem` components as children.
- Organize nodes in a clear hierarchy, with parent nodes at higher levels and child nodes at lower levels.
- Allow users to expand and collapse nodes to focus on specific parts of the hierarchy.
- Use custom styles if the tree needs to support more than 10 levels of nesting.
- Provide an alternative way to represent the tree structure by flattening it into a list of items.
- Consider using virtualization to improve performance for large tree structures.
- Use the `aria-label` attribute on the root of the Tree component to provide an accessible name for the tree.
