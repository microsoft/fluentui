# @fluentui/react-infobutton Spec

Convergence epic issue: [#25062](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues/25062)

## Background

An InfoButton provides a way for users to get more information about a particular UI element. It is a button containing an icon that, when clicked, displays a Popover with the additional information. InfoButton may contain focusable items inside the Popover.

Because the Popover isn't always visible, it should not contain information that people must know in order to complete the field.

#### Comparison with v0 and v8

- v0 does not have an InfoButton component.
- v8 does not have an InfoButton component, but does have a TextField component that has an example of how to add an info button to a TextField, see "Prior Art" section above for more details.

## Sample Code

```jsx
<InfoButton info="This is some additional information." />
```

## API

#### Props

See (InfoButton.types.ts)[../src/components/InfoButton/InfoButton.types.ts] for more API details.

## Structure

_**Public**_

```jsx
<InfoButton
  info={
    <>
      Popover above-start lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.
      <Link href="https://react.fluentui.dev">Learn more</Link>
    </>
  }
/>
```

_**Internal**_

```jsx
return (
  <slots.popover {...(slotProps.popover as PopoverProps)}>
    <PopoverTrigger>
      <slots.root {...slotProps.root} />
    </PopoverTrigger>
    <slots.info {...slotProps.info} />
  </slots.popover>
);
```

_**DOM**_

```html
<button type="button" class="fui-InfoButton">
  <!-- icon -->
</button>

<!-- on document.body -->
<div role="tooltip" class="fui-PopoverSurface fui-InfoButton__info">
  Popover above-start lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur.
  <a href="https://react.fluentui.dev">Learn more</a>
</div>
```

## Migration

There's no migration guide as `v0` and `v8` do not have an InfoButton component.

## Behaviors

> Note: The behavior will change when used in conjunction with the `Field` component. It is mentioned that when a form has many InfoButtons, it may be better to not make a full tab stop in the button. The idea is to have each field have a "shortcut" that will let you focus on the infobutton. This will be implemented by Field if needed.

- _Component States_
  - Popover open: The Popover is open and content visible.
- _Interaction_
  - _Keyboard_
    - `Enter` or `Space` key: Opens the Popover.
      - Focusable items in Popover: Focus is moved to the `PopoverSurface` and focusable items can be accessed by tabbing.
      - No focusable items in Popover: Focus is moved to the `PopoverSurface`.
      - `Escape` key: Closes the Popover.
  - _Cursor_
    - `Click`: Opens the Popover.
    - `Click` outside of Popover: Closes the Popover.
  - _Touch_
    - `Tap`: Opens the Popover.
    - `Tap` outside of Popover: Closes the Popover.
  - _Screen readers_
    - When focusing on the button, the screen reader should announce "{label associated to} information button collapsed".
    - When the Popover is opened, the focus moves to the `PopoverSurface` and the screen reader announces the content of the `PopoverSurface` and "note" at the end.

## Accessibility

- `PopoverSurfaces`'s role is `note` and its `tabIndex` is set to `-1`.
- The button's `aria-label` is `information`.
- Tab order
  - When tabbing through the page, the button should be a tab stop.
  - When focused on the button, pressing `Enter` or `Space` should open the Popover.
  - When the Popover is open, focus is moved to the `PopoverSurface`.
  - When focused on the `PopoverSurface` or content within it, pressing `Escape` should close the Popover.

## InfoButton vs. InfoIcon

There are two use cases we want to tackle, covering these means covering the 80-90% of use cases:

1. When the bubble has a few words and no interactive elements.
2. When the bubble may have more than a few sentences and interactive elements.

After considering the options, we've decided to have two controls that will cover these use cases. The first one will be InfoIcon which will cover the first use case and the second one will be InfoButton which will cover the second use case.

### InfoIcon - Icon with a Tooltip

- An InfoIcon is an icon that has a tooltip.
- InfoIcons must keep the default cursor even when hovered.
- InfoIcons are opened when hovered or focused.
- InfoIcons do not move focus when opened.

### InfoButton - InfoButton with a Popover

- An InfoButton is a button that has a Popover attached to it.
- InfoButtons must use the pointer cursor to show this is a button and will have a backplate to differenciate the icon vs button.
- InfoButtons do not open when focused/hovered, instead they open on click/space/enter.
- InfoButton's bubble can be dismissed by pressing Escape, clicking outside the bubble, moving focus away from the bubble, or clicking the button again.
- InfoButton has role note and moves focus to the Popover's surface.

## InfoButtonLabel and InfoIconLabel

To avoid having accessibility issues, we will be providing these controls in the form of InfoIconLabel and InfoButtonLabel. These will provide an out of the box accessibility ready experience.
