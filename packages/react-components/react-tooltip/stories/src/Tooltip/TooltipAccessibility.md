## Accessibility

Tooltips should always wrap interactive controls like buttons, links, form fields, gridcells, etc. For tooltips that should be triggered by static icons, the `InfoLabel` control is available as an accessible tooltip-like pattern.

Tooltips should not be used to provide a full-text alternative to truncated content. For more infomation on the accessibility of truncated content, see our [truncation docs](https://react.fluentui.dev/?path=/docs/concepts-developer-accessibility-truncation--docs).
