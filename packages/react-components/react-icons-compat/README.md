# @fluentui/react-icons-compat

**React Icons utility functions to help with migration from v8 to v9 [Fluent UI React](https://react.fluentui.dev/)**

It is recommended to use this package only if you still need to use functions such as `registerIcons` from v8 icons. Otherwise it is recommended that you use the v9 icons directly from `@fluentui/react-icons`.
