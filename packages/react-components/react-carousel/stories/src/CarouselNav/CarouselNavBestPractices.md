## Best practices

### Do

- Use CarouselNavImageButton for image based carousels or when a preview is needed.
- Use default CarouselNavButton for most interactions.
- Use appearance='branded' in situations where the default gray scale may not be appropriate.

### Don't

- Remove transparent underlay background, as it is required for the buttons to be accessible when overlaid on non-neutral backgrounds.
