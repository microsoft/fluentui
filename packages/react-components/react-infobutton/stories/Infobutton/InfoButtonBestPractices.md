### Do

- Prefer using an `InfoLabel` if the `InfoButton` is intended to be associated with a label.
- Set `aria-label` to an appropriate value if the `InfoButton` is not associated with a label.

### Don't

- Because the Popover isn't always visible, don't include information that people must know in order to complete the field.
