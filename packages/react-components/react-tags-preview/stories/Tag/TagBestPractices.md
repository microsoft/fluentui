## Best practices

### Do

- To group multiple tags together, use `TagGroup`. `TagGroup` can handle dismiss of multiple `Tag`.

- Dismissible `Tag` should provide information to screen readers about the dismiss action. For example `dismissIcon={{ 'aria-label': 'remove' }}`.

### Don't

- Don't change the interaction on a `Tag` because it should only be dismissible. Instead, use `InteractionTag` if you need a different type of interaction.

- Don't use `media` together with `icon`.
