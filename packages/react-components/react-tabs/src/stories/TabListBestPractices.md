 Best Practices
</summary>

### Do

- Use on content-heavy pages that require a significant amount of scrolling to access the various sections.
- Be concise on the tab names, ideally one or two words rather than a phrase.
- When tabs have icons but not text labels, use `aria-label` to describe the tab.

### Don't

- Use a tab to open a new page or take other actions than showing content.
- Use a tab list for routed navigation in an application.
