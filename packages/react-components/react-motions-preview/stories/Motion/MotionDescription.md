`@fluentui/react-motions` implements definitions for motion animations that can be used in Fluent UI components. These animations are used to provide visual feedback to users when they interact with components.

This implementation is based on [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API) and defines atoms & transitions that can be used to create animation components.

- Atoms are the smallest building blocks of animations
- Transitions are the combination of atoms that define the in/out animation
