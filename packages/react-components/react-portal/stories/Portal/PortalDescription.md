A portal renders content outside of a DOM tree, at the end of the document. This allows content to escape traditional boundaries caused by `"overflow: hidden"` CSS rules and keeps it on the top without using `z-index` rules. This is useful for example in `Menu` and `Tooltip` scenarios, where the content should always overlay everything else.

`Portal` component is a thin wrapper around React's [`ReactDOM.createPortal()`](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html) that propagates Fluent styling (allows to use `tokens`) and text-direction handling to the content. You can identify DOM created by `Portal` by looking for the `data-portal-node` attribute.
