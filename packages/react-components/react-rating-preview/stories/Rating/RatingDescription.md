A `Rating` component allows users to provide a rating for a particular item.

`Rating` displays a set of stars or other symbols that represent the rating value. It can also display the value represented by the `Rating`, as well as the number of users who have given a rating. Users can interact with the component to select a rating by clicking on the stars or using touch gestures.
