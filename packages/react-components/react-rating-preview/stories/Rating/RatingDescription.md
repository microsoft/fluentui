A `Rating` component allows users to provide a rating for a particular item.

`Rating` allows customers to determine a sense of value of a good or a service. By default, the rating is selected out of 5 stars, but the number and symbol used can be customized.

To display the result of other users' rating values, use `RatingDisplay` instead.
