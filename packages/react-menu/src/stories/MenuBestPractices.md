## Best practices

### Do

- Use `MenuList` as the only child of `MenuPopover`.
- Create nested menus as separate components.
- Use the `hasIcons` prop for alignment if only some menu items have icons.
- Use the `hasCheckmarks` prop for alignment if only some menu items are selectable.
- Use sentence-style capitalizationâ€”only capitalize the first word. For more info, see
  [Capitalization](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/capitalization) in the Microsoft Writing Style Guide.

### Don't

- Don't render focusable or clickable items inside menu items.
- Don't use more than 2 levels of nested menus.
- Don't use verbose secondary content for menuitems.
- Don't mix checkboxes and radio items without `MenuGroup`.
