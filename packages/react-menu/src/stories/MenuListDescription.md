> This page shows usage information specific to `MenuList`. All examples in the `Menu` documentation are also applicatble
> for `MenuList` since it is used as a child component of `Menu`.

A permanently displayed menu. It's exposed to allow easier customiztion of the `Menu` component. You can also use this
component separately in other temporary surfaces such as `Popover`.

This component will configure correct keyboard navigation of menuitems, so once the focus is inside `MenuList` the
component is fully accessible. If using this component separately make sure the component is focused appropriately
for keyboard users.
