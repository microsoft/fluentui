An accordion is a vertically stacked group of collapsible sections. An accordion is composed of grouped buttons and panels. When a user selects an accordion button, its corresponding panel should switch between 'open' and 'collapsed' states.

Accordions follow many consistent patterns but do allow for some variability in behavior. For example, some accordions only allow one panel to be open at a time, where others may allow multiple or all panels to be open simultaneously. Similarly, many accordions will allow all panels to be simultaneously collapsed, while others may require one panel to be open at all times.

If you are familiar with the disclosure pattern, an accordion will feel very similar. The key distinction is that a disclosure is a standalone component that consists of a single button-panel-group. Because of this, you cannot navigate between different disclosures with a keyboard the same way you can with an accordion.
