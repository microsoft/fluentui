## FAQ

### I want to add an image to use it in examples. How I can do this?

Please create a separate PR and put it into `packages/fluentui/docs/src/public` directory. Once that PR will be merged it will be available at CDN. For example, `packages/fluentui/docs/src/public/images/fluent-ui-logo.png` is available on CDN as [https://fabricweb.azureedge.net/fabric-website/assets/images/fluent-ui-logo.png](https://fabricweb.azureedge.net/fabric-website/assets/images/fluent-ui-logo.png).

Once an image that was added on CDN will be available it can be used in examples.
