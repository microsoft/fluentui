Fluent UI components can have "slots" which accept shothand props. For example, `Loader` component has an `label` slot which value defines the message that will appear together with the loading indicator.

```jsx
<Loader label="Fetching data..." />
```

There are several forms of shorthand values that can be provided, but all of them share one common thing - each is eventually evaluated to React Element. Thus, you can think of shorthand values as a recipe to customize rendered React Element.

## Object as value

Each component's slot has associated default element type. For example, by default there is
`<Text />` element rendered for `Loader`'s `label` slot. It is possible to customize props of this default element by providing props object as shorthand value:

```jsx
// üí° 'content' and 'size' will be used as <Text /> element's props
<Loader label={{ content: 'Fetching data...', size: 'small' }} />
```

## Primitive as value

There is even shorter way to define default element's props - by using a primitive value. In that case provided shorthand value will be taken as a value for "default prop" of this element.

This could be much easier seen with an example. Here, again, we have a `Loader`
element with its label being defined with shorthand - where provided `string` value
will be used as label's `content`:

```jsx
<>
  <Loader label="Fetching data..." />
  {/* üí° has identical effect to the previous one */}
  <Loader label={{ content: 'Fetching data...' }} />
</>
```

This works because `content` is the default prop of shorthand's `<Text />` element. You can also pass React Elements to slots:

```jsx
<>
  <Popup content={<em>Awesome Popup!</em>} />
  {/* üí° has identical effect to the previous one */}
  <Popup content={{ content: <em>Awesome Popup!</em> }} />
</>
```

### Disable slot's rendering

It is also possible to pass falsy values (`false`, `null` or
`undefined`) to shorthand prop - in that case there will be nothing rendered for the component's slot.

```jsx
<Dropdown toggleIndicator={null} />
```

## Using Render Props

Our components implement [`render props`](https://reactjs.org/docs/render-props.html) technique to allow customize rendered output or wrap component slots. All Fluent UI components support it via `children` prop on shorthand objects, for example:

```jsx
<Attachment
  header="Contacts.docx"
  action={{
    content: '?',
    children: (
      Component /* evaluated `ElementType`, `Button` in this case */,
      props /* necessary attributes (including accessibility) that should be applied */,
    ) => <Tooltip content="Help..." trigger={<Component {...props} />} />,
  }}
/>
```

You can also use this technique to completely replace slot contents:

```jsx
<Loader
  label={{
    /* ‚ö†Ô∏è Replacement without applying props can break accessibility and styling concerns */
    children: () => <span>Loading data...</span>,
  }}
/>
```

### Use with shorthand collections

The same approach can be used with components that accept shorthand collections, for example `Menu`:

```jsx
<Menu
  items={[
    {
      key: 'first',
      content: 'First',
      tooltip: 'First item',
      children: (Component, props) => {
        /* ‚òùÔ∏è `tooltip` comes from shorthand object */
        const { tooltip, ...rest } = props;

        return <Tooltip content={tooltip} trigger={<Component {...props} />} />;
      },
    },
  ]}
/>
```
