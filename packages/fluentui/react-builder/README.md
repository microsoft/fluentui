# Fluent UI React Builder

## Usage

### Requirements

Node

Yarn

### Getting Started

#### Command line setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. From the root folder (fluentui), run `yarn` to install required dependencies. This may take a while.
3. To build the project, run `yarn start:northstar`. Upon success, the builder can be found at `localhost:8080`. Happy building!

## Features

### State

While the scope of the app is small (blueline tool) we are just using React's state management.

If the scope grows, the state management solution may change.

### Takeaways

Tree nested vs flat

iframe callback vs messages

### Dropping

- Assumes all components can be dropped on all others (allow for config of this)
