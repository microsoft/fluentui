# @fluentui/react-cards

> **For the converged Card components, see `@fluentui/react-card` instead.**

**Deprecated experimental Card components for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**
([formerly Office UI Fabric React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/))

These components never graduated from experimental status and were going to be removed in Fluent UI React version 8, but they've been added back for now to avoid breaking apps that were already using them. **Do not use these components in new code!**
