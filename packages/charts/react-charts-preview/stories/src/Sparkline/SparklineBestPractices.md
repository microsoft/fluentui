### Layout

A standard sparkline component is comprised of a single area chart. The value shown to the right of the sparkline represents the latest data of the trendline. It does not represent the average value of the data plotted. Most scenarios that require sparklines typically need only green and red to show positive or negative trend, respectively. If representing a neutral trend, use `Comm Blue #0078D4`. However, the color of the sparkline can be customized to suit your product and scenario you’re designing for. You can use positive, negative, and neutral colors next to each other.
