### Best Practices for Using Scatter/Bubble Charts

1. **Use for Correlation Analysis**:

   - Scatter charts are ideal for identifying relationships or correlations between two numerical variables (e.g., sales vs. profit).

2. **Limit Data Points**:

   - Avoid overcrowding the chart with too many data points, as it can make the visualization cluttered and hard to interpret.

3. **Use Bubble Size Wisely**:
   - In bubble charts, ensure the size of the bubbles is proportional to the third variable and does not obscure other data points.
