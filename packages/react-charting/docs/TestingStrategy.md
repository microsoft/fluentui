**Example: How to Add Tests for Donut Chart**

![](./images/TestingStrategy/DonutCoverage.png)

**Step 1 [Unit Tests]:**

1. Identify the functions that can be unit tested (example, functions having calculations or getting values from Utils, etc).

If required, extract the unit testable portions out of the functions which can be independently unit tested without any requirement of DOM elements.

1. **convertToLocaleString()** [src/components/DonutChart/DonutChart.base.tsx]
2. **getAccessibleDataObject()** [src/components/DonutChart/DonutChart.base.tsx]
3. **\_valueInsideDonut()** [src/components/DonutChart/DonutChart.base.tsx]
4. **wrapTextInsideDonut()** [src/components/DonutChart/Pie.tsx]
5. **\_computeTotalValue()** [src/components/DonutChart/Pie.tsx]

6. Identify the parts within those functions which cannot be tested via unit tests.

7. **wrapTextInsideDonut() -** cannot be unit tested as it requires the tspan length to be calculated using Browser Functions like **getComputedTextLength()**
8. **\_computeTotalValue() -** depends on the data prop passed down from the DonutChart.base to Pie during component rendering

**Step 2 [Component Tests]:**

1. Identify the component level scenarios that can be tested (as per the test plan). - Component Test Plan
2. Identify if the parts in Step 1 (ii) can be covered via component tests.

3. **\_computeTotalValue() -** can be covered by component tests by passing the data prop during component rendering.

4. Identify the scenarios which cannot be covered via Step 2(I and ii).

5. **wrapTextInsideDonut() -** cannot be unit/component tested as it requires the tspan length to be calculated using Browser Functions like **getComputedTextLength()**

**Step 3 [E2E Tests]:**

1. Identify the E2E scenarios that can be covered (as per the test plan) - Visual Regression with Interaction Test Plan â€“ Donut Chart
2. Cover all the test scenarios which could not be covered either in Step 1 or in Step 2.

3. **wrapTextInsideDonut() -** can be covered by E2E tests as the component is now rendered in a browser.

**Conclusion:**

As per our discussion with Martin on being consistent with Fluent library and due to the limitation of Enzyme not being compatible with the newer React 18, "My comment on the PR was more about going into the future and actual [Office 365 common dependency alignment,](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fteams.microsoft.com%2Fl%2Fmessage%2F19%3A383bdf2ab03e4d9db0a86225b08a61cd%40thread.tacv2%2F1675850066705%3FtenantId%3D72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47%26groupId%3D4026aab5-5f82-4e6b-baac-324d6275db35%26parentMessageId%3D1675850066705%26teamName%3D1JS%2520Developers%26channelName%3DGeneral%26createdTime%3D1675850066705&data=05%7C01%7CSreetama.Mukherjee%40microsoft.com%7C2d55d9a4ea77434cf46908db31433ec1%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638157937130123054%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=U6pTMegvDbdv7FCrbwQlDVlghHeXMra4yw2bASLskI8%3D&reserved=0) where they are going to migrate to react 18 within repos, which makes enzyme useless as there are no adapters that work with react 18.

From architectural POV context, enzyme was never a good choice, but because react community evolving and learning patterns it got very big adoption even within fluent.

I'd encourage folks within your team to plan ahead and starting using solution that don't test that much low-level details, which often creates brittle tests, by leveraging [react testing library](https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftesting-library.com%2Fdocs%2Freact-testing-library%2Fintro%2F&data=05%7C01%7CSreetama.Mukherjee%40microsoft.com%7C2d55d9a4ea77434cf46908db31433ec1%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C638157937130278718%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=5J3WzB04YevaW%2BuTYhdcjWJP0osltgG4wvrQH8qhSjA%3D&reserved=0) and its ecosystem.

**[Any New Test we add should be using React Testing Library.]**
