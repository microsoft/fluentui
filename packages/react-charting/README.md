**Overview**

[Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)
([formerly Office UI Fabric React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/)) charts is a set of modern, accessible, interactive and highly customizable visualization library representing the Microsoft design system.

The charting library is built using [D3 (Data Driven Documents)](https://github.com/d3/d3) and other fluent UI controls.

These charts are used across different products in Microsoft. They are ready to be used in a production environment.

This library is also supported for fluent UI [v7](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/tree/7.0).

## Using the library

Examples and code snippets for the charting library are available on the [demo site](https://aka.ms/fluentcharting).
The code snippets can be used as usage guide for all the props and chart variations. Click on 'Show code' on the demo site to access demo for each variant.

The library is published as a npm package to public npm feed. To install the package

```js
npm install @fluentui/react-charting
```

To import charting components:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@fluentui/react-charting/lib/ComponentName';
```
