## Using Fluent UI React

### Creating a new app

To create a simple React app using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev), [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org), then run:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template @fluentui/cra-template
cd my-app
npm start
```

### Integrating in an existing project

```sh
npm i @fluentui/react
```

This will add the package as a dependency in your `package.json` file and download it under `node_modules/@fluentui/react`.

The library includes ES module entry points under the `lib` folder (use `lib-amd` if you need AMD, or `lib-commonjs` if you need commonjs).

### Version policy

Fluent UI React adheres to [semantic versioning](http://www.semver.org/). However, we only consider constructs directly importable at the package level or from files at the root (e.g. `@fluentui/react/lib/Utilities` or `@fluentui/react/lib-amd/Styling`) to be part of our API surface. Everything else is considered package-internal and may be subject to changes, moves, renames, etc.

### Browser support

Fluent UI React supports all evergreen browsers, with IE 11 as the min-bar version of Internet Explorer. See the [browser support doc](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Browser-Support) for more information.

### Right-to-left support

All components can render in LTR or RTL, depending on the `dir` attribute set on the `html` element (`dir="rtl"` will flip the direction of everything). You can also use the `setRTL` API if you don't have control over the `html` element's rendering. Example:

```tsx
import { setRTL } from '@fluentui/react/lib/Utilities';

setRTL(true);
```

### Server-side rendering

Fluent UI React components can be rendered in a server-side Node environment (or used in tests which run in an SSR-like environment), but it requires customizing how styles and SCSS files are loaded. See the [server-side rendering documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Server-side-rendering-and-browserless-testing) for examples of how to handle this.

### Advanced usage

For info about advanced usage including module- vs. path-based imports, using an AMD bundler like RequireJS, and deployment features, see our [advanced documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/wiki/Advanced-Usage).
