# @fluentui/react-radio Spec

## Background

The Radio component let people select a single option from two or more choices. Use radio component to present all available choices up to 7 options.

Fabric expects the options to be provided through the `options` prop. The selected value is the key of the option using the `selectedKey`.
Fabric allows options to have image instead of a label.

```jsx
<ChoiceGroup
  defaultSelectedKey="B"
  options={[
    { key: 'A', text: 'Option A' },
    { key: 'B', text: 'Option B' },
    { key: 'C', text: 'Option C', disabled: true },
    { key: 'D', text: 'Option D' },
  ]}
  label="Pick one"
  required={true}
/>
```

Northstar's implementation consists of `RadioGroup` that includes two or more `RadioItems`, which are given thorugh the `items` prop.

```jsx
<RadioGroup
  onCheckedValueChange={handleChange}
  items={[
    { key: '1', label: 'Make your choice', value: '1' },
    { key: '2', label: 'Another option', value: '2' },
  ]}
/>
```

Questions‚ùì

- what requirements should Radio fulfil in order to be compatible/used with Field?
- Is it thought of that Radio, input etc. to be coupled with Field or they can stand on their own?

```jsx
<Field className="rootClass" label="hello" description={<div>fancy hello</div>} errorMessage="aka.ms/nohello" required>
  <RadioGroup items={[{}, {}]} />
</Field>
```

## Proposal

`RadioItem` as a small customizable component:

```jsx
options.map(option => <RadioItem checked={option.text === 'Option A'} {...option}>)
```

Maybe use Field or another component likse RadioGroup to be used with RadioItem ?.

## Sample Code

_Provide some representative example code that uses the proposed API for the component_

## Variants

_Describe visual or functional variants of this control, if applicable. For example, a slider could have a 2D variant._

## API

_List the **Props** and **Slots** proposed for the component. Ideally this would just be a link to the component's `.types.ts` file_

## Structure

- _**Public**_
- _**Internal**_
- _**DOM** - how the component will be rendered as HTML elements_

## Migration

_Describe what will need to be done to upgrade from the existing implementations:_

- _Migration from v8_
- _Migration from v0_

## Behaviors

_Explain how the component will behave in use, including:_

- _Component States_
- _Interaction_
  - _Keyboard_
  - _Cursor_
  - _Touch_
  - _Screen readers_

## Accessibility

Base accessibility information is included in the design document. After the spec is filled and review, outcomes from it need to be communicated to design and incorporated in the design document.

- Decide whether to use **native element** or folow **ARIA** and provide reasons
- Identify the **[ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/) pattern** and, if the component is listed there, follow its specification as possible.
- Identify accessibility **variants**, the `role` ([ARIA roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#role_definitions)) of the component, its `slots` and `aria-*` props.
- Describe the **keyboard navigation**: Tab Oder and Arrow Key Navigation. Describe any other keyboard **shortcuts** used
- Specify texts for **state change announcements** - [ARIA live regions
  ](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) (number of available items in dropdown, error messages, confirmations, ...)
- Identify UI parts that appear on **hover or focus** and specify keyboard and screen reader interaction with them
- List cases when **focus** needs to be **trapped** in sections of the UI (for dialogs and popups or for hierarchical navigation)
- List cases when **focus** needs to be **moved programatically** (if parts of the UI are appearing/disappearing or other cases)
