# @fluentui/make-styles

**Make Styles components for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**

These are not production-ready modules and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

Please refer to [react-make-styles/README.md](../react-make-styles/README.md) for more details.
