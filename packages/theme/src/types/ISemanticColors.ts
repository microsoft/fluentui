/**
 * The collection of all semantic slots for colors used in themes.
 *
 * Note: text colors are defined in ISemanticTextColors.ts.
 * We plan to move completely to semantic slots and replace all usage of Fabric palette slots.
 * We've been actively making some of these changes but still have a ways to go. At present,
 * we're only adding slots if absolutely necessary because we are trying to avoid bloating
 * the already sizeable offering. We're also working on a better solution for design tokens
 * overall in our next iteration. We'll provide an update on this site when that's ready.
 * Thank you for your patience.
 *
 * #### Naming Convention
 *
 * The name of a semantic slot can quickly tell you how it’s meant to be used. It generally follows this format:
 *
 * `[category name][element name][Checked][Hovered/Pressed/Disabled state]`
 *
 * * `[category name]` – The “family” that this slot belongs to.
 * * `[element name]` – The name of the thing being targeted, such as the background or border.
 * * `[Checked]` – Whether the thing is checked. We assume things are unchecked by default, so no need to specify the
 * unchecked state. (“Checked” refers to anything that is on, selected, toggled, highlighted, emphasized, etc.)
 * * `[Hovered/Pressed/Disabled state]` – One of these states, if applicable. Each of these states are mutually
 * exclusive. Pressed styles overwrite hovered styles, and disabled elements cannot be hovered or pressed.
 *
 * #### Base Slots
 *
 * A basic set of slots that provide many default body styles, such as text, subtext, disabled colors, and so on.
 * If a category doesn't provide the slot you're looking for, use one from this category.
 * For example, the placeholder text on a text input field has no corresponding slot in its category,
 * so you'd use the bodySubtextColor from this category.
 *
 * #### Invariants
 *
 * When color has meaning, we do not want to change the color much theme to theme. For example, we
 * will always want errors to be some shade of red, but we will need to tweak the exact shade so it's
 * legible depending on whether it's an inverted theme or not.
 * Invariant colors should almost never be changed by the theme, the defaults should suffice.
 *
 * #### Input Controls
 *
 * This category contains input components commonly used to denote state, including radio buttons,
 * check boxes, toggle switches, sliders, progress bars, and more.
 *
 * #### Buttons
 *
 * Buttons! And all the flavors thereof.
 *
 * #### Menus
 *
 * Any kind of popup menus uses this category.
 *
 * #### Lists
 *
 * Lists differ from menus in that they are designed to show infinite amounts of items, often scroll,
 * and have a large and complex interaction surface.
 * This category covers all kinds of lists, whether they're typical one-item-per-row lists (like DetailsList)
 * or ones with a tiled layout.
