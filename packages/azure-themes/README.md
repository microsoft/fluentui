##### AzureThemes components for Office UI Fabric React

These are not production ready components and **should never be used in product**. This AzureThemes space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import AzureThemes components:

```js
import { AzureCustomizations } from '@uifabric/azure-themes';
```

Once the AzureThemes component graduates to a production release, the component will be available at:

```js
import { AzureCustomizations } from 'office-ui-fabric-react';
```
