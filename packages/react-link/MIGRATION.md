# Link Migration

## STATUS: WIP ðŸš§

This Migration guide is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.

## Migration from v8

The existing `Link` control supports a very similar set of props to the one being proposed with a few differences that are outlined below:

- `componentRef` => NOT SUPPORTED - use regular `ref` instead.
- `styles` => NOT SUPPORTED - use new styling system via `tokens` instead.
- `theme` => NOT SUPPORTED
- `underline` => `inline`

## Migration from v0

v0 does not currently export a `Link` component.

## Property mapping

| v8 `Link`      | Converged `Link` |
| -------------- | ---------------- |
| `componentRef` | -                |
| `disabled`     | `disabled`       |
| `href`         | `href`           |
| `onClick`      | `onClick`        |
| `rel`          | `rel`            |
| `styles`       | -                |
| `target`       | `target`         |
