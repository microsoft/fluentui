# @fluentui/theme-samples

**Theme samples for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**
([formerly Office UI Fabric React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/office/blogs/ui-fabric-is-evolving-into-fluent-ui/))

This is not a production-ready package and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for serving as an example for theme definition and for testing new themes before finalizing them for use elsewhere.

To import sample themes:

```js
import { ThemeName } from '@fluentui/theme-samples';
```
