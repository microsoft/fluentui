# Text Migration

## STATUS: WIP ðŸš§

This Migration guide is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.

## Migration from v8

## Migration from v0

The v0 Text is similar to the converged Text.
The converged component does not support many of the v0 properties that had very specific usages, such as: `important`, `success`, `error` etc.

## Property mapping
