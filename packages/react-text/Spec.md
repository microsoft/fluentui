# @fluentui/react-text Spec

## Background

Text is a typography and styling abstraction component that can be used to ensure the consistency of all text across your application.

Fabric used the `variant` prop to set any styling/format to the Text component, while also providing other utilities like `nowrap` and `block`.

```jsx
<Text>This is a Text component</Text>

<Text variant="medium">Text</Text>

<Text block>Text</Text>

<Text nowrap>Text with ellipsis</Text>
```

Stardust's approach provides a more open API, allowing the user to customize `Text` to their own specific needs.

```jsx
<Text weight="light" content="This text is light." />

<Text color="green" content="Green text" />

<Text align="end" content="Text aligned to end" />

<Text error content="There has been an error." />

<Text disabled content="This feature has been disabled." />
```

## API Proposal

The new Text will provide props to customize text according to the standards defined by Fluent design. The component will not be tied down to specific application usage, like Stardust did, for example, with `mention` and `timestamp` props, and will allow a bigger degree of freedom when customizing, unlike we did in Fabric.
We're also introducing a new concept of wrappers for the main design variants (i.e. 'Title', 'Subtitle', 'Caption') to improve readability and semantics of the code. The wrappers are expected to have fixed styles in terms of size and font family, but flexible for the other supported props in Text.
These wrappers follow the Fluent UI language so for any deviation, regarding the fixed styles mentioned above, should use the Text component instead, given that this is fully customizable.

| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------- |

| block         | boolean                                                                | false         |          |
| italic        | boolean                                                                | false         |          |
| underline     | boolean                                                                | false         |          |
| strikethrough | boolean                                                                | false         |          |
| size          | number - 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000             | 300           |          |
| font          | string - "base" \| "monospace" \| "numeric"                            | "base"        |          |
| weight        | string - "regular" \| "medium" \| "semibold"                           | "regular"     |          |
| align         | string - "start" \| "center" \| "end" \| "justify"                     | "start"       |          |

### make-styles rules

Finally, we're also making available the styling used internally in Text for a lightweight styling solution if you want to avoid using Text or the added JavaScript layers of Text/wrappers.
This is achieved with the `make-styles` rules being available to the user so that they can follow the Fluent design standards for Typography.

## Sample Code

### Using Text

```jsx
<Text weight="semibold" size={1000}>This text is semibold and huge.</Text>

<Text align="end" italic>Text aligned to the end</Text>

<Text strikethrough>This text has a strikethrough.</Text>
```

### Using the wrappers

```jsx
<Display bold>This text is huge.</Display>
<LargeTitle>This is a large title.</LargeTitle>
<Title as="h1">Title</Title>
<Subtitle as="h2">Sub title</Subtitle>
<Caption>Captioned</Caption>
```

### Using styles directly

```jsx
import { useTypographyStyles } from '@fluentui/react-text';

const Test = () => {
  const typographyStyles = useTypographyStyles();

  return (
    <>
      <span className={typographyStyles.display}>I am styled like a display</span>
      <span className={typographyStyles.title}>I am styled like a title</span>
      <span className={typographyStyles.subtitle}>I am styled like a subtitle</span>
    </>
  );
};
```

## Behaviours

### Screen readers

#### Truncate

When using a screen reader, truncated text will be read completely, as truncation is used strictly to prevent text overflow.

Sample:

```jsx
<Text truncate>This is a very long text that will be truncated.</Text>
```

Visual result:

```
This is a very long text...
```

Screen reader:

```
This is a very long text that will be truncated.
```

## Accesibility

Accessibility is included in the entirety of the spec and there are no specific themes to address here.
