A persona is used for a visual representation of a person across the products, typically showcasing the image that a user has chosen to upload themselves. The control can also be used to show the online status of that person. 
 
 
The complete control is comprised of an individual's avatar (an uploaded image or a composition of the person’s initials on a background color), their name or identification, and online status. 
 
 
The persona control is used in the PeoplePicker and Facepile controls.
