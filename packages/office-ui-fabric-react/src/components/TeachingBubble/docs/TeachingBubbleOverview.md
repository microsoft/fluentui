TeachingBubbles are a special kind of [Callout](#/controls/web/callout) used to prominently display important hints to a specific part of a page. They should be used to educate the user about an element that may be easy to miss, such as a new feature or option in the UI. Because they increase engagement with a part of the UI, they are often paired with [Coachmarks](#/controls/web/coachmark).

TeachingBubbles are usually invoked by a system change rather than a user action, so they should generally not be used to show supplemental information or helper text. This is better suited for Callouts or [Tooltips](#/controls/web/tooltip), which are used to simplify interactions. TeachingBubbles should be used to temporarily highlight a feature and should only be shown for a limited time; they should not be permanent parts of a UX.

TeachingBubbles should otherwise follow the same usage guidance as Callouts.
