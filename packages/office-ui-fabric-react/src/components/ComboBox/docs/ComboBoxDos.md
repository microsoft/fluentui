- Use a ComboBox when there are multiple choices that can be collapsed under one title. Or if the list of items is long or when space is constrained.
- ComboBoxs contain shortened statements or words.
- Use a ComboBox when the selected option is more important than the alternatives (in contrast to radio buttons where all the choices are visible putting more emphasis on the other options).
