ScrollablePane is a helper component designed to use in conjunction with a Sticky component. Sticky components will "stick" to the top or bottom of a ScrollablePane's scrollable region and remain visible. ScrollablePane requires a height or max-height set either on the component itself, or on the immediate parent element.
