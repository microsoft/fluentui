- ScrollablePane uses `position: absolute`. Ensure that the parent element has an explicit `height` and `position: relative`, or has space already allocated for ScrollablePane (e.g: flexbox).
- Use Sticky component on block level elements
- Sticky component are ideally section headers and/or footers
- Ensure that the total height of Sticky components do not exceed the height of the ScrollablePane
