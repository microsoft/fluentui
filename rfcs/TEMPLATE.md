# RFC: Your proposal name here

<!--
An RFC can be anything. A question, a suggestion, a plan. The purpose of this template is to give some structure to help folks write successful RFCs. However, don't feel constrained by this template; use your best judgement.

Tips for writing a successful RFC:

- Simple plain words that make your point, fancy words obfuscate
- Try to stay concise, but don't gloss over important details
- Try to write a neutral problem statement, not one that motivates your desired solution
- Remember, "Writing is thinking". It's natural to realize new ideas while writing your proposal
