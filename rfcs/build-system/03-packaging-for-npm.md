# RFC: Packaging for npm registry

## Summary

## Problem statement

We ship lot of unnecessary stuff to our consumers:

- story files
- source files
- various configurations and metadata
- others...

What we ship is driven by our current npm package setup, which looks like following:

**`<package>/.npmignore`**

```
*.api.json
*.config.js
*.log
*.nuspec
*.test.*
*.yml
.editorconfig
.eslintrc*
.eslintcache
.gitattributes
.gitignore
.vscode
coverage
dist/storybook
dist/*.stats.html
dist/*.stats.json
dist/demo
fabric-test*
gulpfile.js
images
index.html
jsconfig.json
node_modules
results
src/**/*
!src/**/examples/*.tsx
!src/**/docs/**/*.md
!src/**/*.types.ts
temp
tsconfig.json
tsd.json
tslint.json
typings
visualtests
```

> **NOTE:** data was acquired by running `npm pack --dry-run` in `packages/react-text`

**Packaged output:**

```
=== Tarball Details ===
name:          @fluentui/react-text
version:       9.0.0-alpha.0
package size:  564.2 kB
unpacked size: 2.2 MB
total files:   1008
```

With manually removed `.cache` folder:

```
=== Tarball Details ===
name:          @fluentui/react-text
version:       9.0.0-alpha.0
package size:  31.1 kB
unpacked size: 263.9 kB
total files:   518
```

> **NOTE:** The issue with `.cache` (Jest cache) was addressed separately by moving the cache under `<package root>/node_modules/.cache/jest`, following the convention used by other tools' caches.

## Detailed Design or Proposal

> **ðŸ’¡ NOTE:** This proposal/guide applies only for vNext packages and libraries using new DX

This is a living document that will describe various proposals that all aim to improve following common goals:

- packaging size to npm registry
- faster install/over the wire transfer/less bytes
- faster packages consumption/processing by consumers
- better security for consumers
- better tree-shaking capabilities

### 1. `.npmignore` cleanup _(implemented)_

**`<package>/.npmignore`**

```sh
.storybook/
.vscode/
bundle-size/
config/
coverage/
e2e/
etc/
node_modules/
src/
temp/
__fixtures__
__mocks__
__tests__

*.api.json
*.log
*.spec.*
*.stories.*
*.test.*
*.yml

# config files
*config.*
*rc.*
.editorconfig
.eslint*
.git*
.prettierignore
```

> **NOTE:** data was acquired by running `npm pack --dry-run` in `packages/react-text`

**Packaged output:**

```
=== Tarball Details ===
name:          @fluentui/react-text
version:       9.0.0-alpha.0
package size:  24.7 kB
unpacked size: 172.8 kB
total files:   250
```

#### Pros

This approach significantly improves our current situation:

- simpler `npmignore` configuration / better maintenance
- only implementation is being shipped (no tests, stories)
- **52% less files**
- **21% smaller packed package size**

#### Cons

- none

#### Discarded Solutions

- using `"files"` withing `package.json`
  - doesn't support exclusion patterns
  - non explicit for human (if `files` property is used, some files will be automatically and always shipped)
  - 2 sources of "truth" (`.npmignore` and `files`)

### 2. shipping only type definition rollup

> **NOTE:** to make this RFC more focused this will be covered in followup PR's if needed

#### Pros

- TBA

#### Cons

- TBA

### 3. shipping only rollup-ed(bundled) implementation files

> **NOTE:** to make this RFC more focused this will be covered in followup PR's if needed

#### Pros

- TBA

#### Cons

- TBA

### 4. package.json post-processing

> **NOTE:** to make this RFC more focused this will be covered in followup PR's if needed

#### Pros

- TBA

#### Cons
