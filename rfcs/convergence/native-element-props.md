## Summary

For certain components, it's necessary to apply top-level native props to an element besides the actual DOM root. This RFC proposes a mechanism for handling this.

This functionality should be used very sparingly to avoid confusion. The most obvious case is for input components (options for exact criteria discussed below).

## Problem statement

For most components, it makes sense to apply native props (and `ref`) to the root element. Currently the `root` slot always gets native element props passed to the component, and is not explicitly exposed via the API.

The input components are a little unique because the actual `<input>` _cannot_ be the root element of the component, since we need various wrappers for styling (and `<input>` can't have children). However, users may expect that some or all native props passed to the root of the component would be applied to the `<input>` itself. This may also be a requirement for certain 3rd-party form libraries.

For example, rendering a `<Checkbox/>` actually does this _(before the RFC is implemented)_:

```tsx
<slots.root>
  <slots.checkmark {/* visual checkmark */} />
  <slots.input {/* actual input */}>
  {children /*label*/}
</slots.root>
```

Or an `<Input/>` is roughly like this _(again pre-RFC)_:

```tsx
<slots.root>
  <slots.bookendBefore />
  <slots.inputWrapper {/* visually styled as the input */}>
    <slots.insideStart />
    <slots.input /> {/* actual input element */}
    <slots.insideEnd />
  </slots.inputWrapper>
  <slots.bookendAfter />
</slots.root>
```

So to specify a value, you'd have to use slot props:

```tsx
<Input input={{ id: 'foo', value: 'stuff' }} />
```

The question of where to apply the top-level `ref` has similar considerations and should likely follow the same pattern as native props.

### Principles for any solution

The chosen solution needs to adhere to the following principles (thanks @levithomason):

- User needs to retain access to any part of DOM at any time (can't make a piece of DOM that's unable to receive props)
- Consider what the user expects when using the component

### Compatibility with 3rd-party libraries

#### For inputs: form validation libraries

To the degree possible, we'd like inputs to work nicely with 3rd-party form libraries, which may have APIs that expect to be able to pass native props to the component and have them applied to the actual `<input>`. (needs more research)

- [Formik](https://github.com/formium/formik)
- [react-hook-form](https://github.com/react-hook-form/react-hook-form)
  - Note, for this one they might need to make a wrapper for our component because the library expects to be able to _set_ `.value` on the input, which presents its own challenges. (Someone brought this up for v8 [here](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues/18126).)
- [React Final Form](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form)

#### For styling: StyledComponents and Emotion

Third-party styling libraries can assume that `className` applies to the root DOM element. Even if we forward other props to an inner element, we should ensure that `className` is always applied to the root.

## Proposed Design

_For reference, this proposal was labeled **Option D** in discussion on [PR #18983](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/pull/18983#issuecomment-910563694)_.

### Introduce the concept of a _primary_ slot

The _**primary**_ slot is the slot that receives the native props that are specified as props of the component itself.

**By default, `root` (the outermost DOM element) is the primary slot.**

- This is the _status quo_: all components worked like this prior to this RFC.
- `root` gets all of the native props specified as props on the component.
- The component does _not_ have a prop called `root`.

**In special cases, a component can designate a different primary slot.**

- All native props are forwarded to the primary slot, _except_ `className` and `style`.
- The `className` and `style` props are _always_ forwarded to the `root` slot.
- Both `root` and the primary slot are exposed as props, to allow for props to be explicitly set on those slots.
- The primary slot is intrinsic to the component, and is part of how it works. Users cannot designate a different slot as primary.

See [Usage examples](#Usage-examples) below for examples of how this works.

### How to pick the primary slot

To avoid confusion from a user standpoint, if we're going to allow varying where top-level native props go, we need a very clear/coherent definition of where people can expect this different behavior, and/or categories of components it applies to.

#### Proposed guidelines

- When a component is wrapping a single underlying HTML element, the primary slot is that element.
- If a component is emulating an HTML element via `role`, the primary slot is the one with the component's primary `role`.
- Otherwise, leave the `root` element as the default (this should apply to most components).

Examples include:

- Input components like `Input`, `Checkbox`, `Dropdown`, etc. These wrap the actual `<input>` or `<select>` element with styling/layout elements, but the `<input>` or `<select>` should be the primary slot.
- Example from v8 (may look different in converged): Modal's actual React root element is usually a Layer, but from a user standpoint it makes a lot more sense to apply top-level props to the modal _content's_ root element.

### Propsed Implementation

#### Typings

The `ComponentProps` type has a template parameter to specify the primary slot:

```ts
export type ComponentProps<Shorthands, Primary extends keyof Shorthands = 'root'> =
  // Put the primary slot's props directly on the ComponentProps
  Shorthands[Primary] &
    // Add shorthand props for the other slots
    {
      [Key in Exclude<
        keyof Shorthands,
        // Exclude `root` only if it is the primary slot
        Primary extends 'root' ? Primary : never
      >]?: ShorthandProps<NonNullable<Shorthands[Key]>>;
    };
```

#### Implementation

Add a function similar to `getNativeElementProps` function, except it handles splitting the `className` and `style` props to the root slot, as well as mixing in the primary slot.

Something along the lines of this (names and API is still a work in progress):

```ts
const [rootProps, inputProps] = getRootAndPrimaryNativeElementProps(props, 'input');
const state = {
  // ...
  root: rootProps,
  input: inputProps, // primary slot
};
```

#### Conformance tests

- Need to be able to specify which is the primary slot in conformance tests
- Check that `className` and `style` always go to the root slot
- Check that slot props take precedence over top-level props (with custom primary slot):
  - `<Input className="foo" root={{ className: 'bar' }} />` => root element has `className="bar"`
  - `<Input id="foo" input={{ id: 'bar' }} />` => input has `id="bar"`
- Check that `<input>` elements are always the primary slot

## Usage examples

### Example with `root` as the primary slot (default case)

`Button` falls into the default case, where `root` is its primary slot. All native props specified on the component go to the `root` slot:

**Given JSX:**

```jsx
<Button id="myId" className="myClass" />
```

**Resulting DOM (simplified):**

```html
<button id="myId" class="myClass" />
```

There is no `root` prop:

```jsx
<Button root={{ id: 'myId' }} /> // ❌ Fails to compile: root is not a prop
```

### Example with `input` as the primary slot

`Checkbox` specifies its `input` slot as the primary slot. (Its `root` slot is a wrapper `<div>` around the `<input>` element.)

**Given JSX:**

```jsx
<Checkbox id="myId" className="myClass" />
```

**Resulting DOM (simplified):**

```html
<div class="myClass">
  <input id="myId" />
</div>
```

If props are specified on the `root` or `input` slots, they always go to the specified slot, and always win over props specified on the element itself:

**Given JSX:**

```jsx
<Checkbox
  id="myId" // ⚠ overridden by "inputId" below
  className="myClass" // ⚠ overridden by "rootClass" below
  style={{ color: 'red' }}
  root={{ id: 'rootId', className: 'rootClass' }}
  input={{ id: 'inputId', className: 'inputClass' }}
/>
```

**Resulting DOM (simplified):**

```html
<div id="rootId" class="rootClass" style="color: red">
  <input id="inputId" class="inputClass" />
</div>
```

## Discarded Solutions

There have been a number of proposals discussed, including on a previous [RFC #18804](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/pull/18804), as well as in earlier iterations of this proposal.

The names of the discarded options reflect their name when they were proposed.

### Option A: allow setting a different "primary" slot; explicitly expose `root` _(formerly the proposed solution)_

Allow setting a different "primary" slot (open to suggestions for the name) where top-level native props and `ref` are applied. This would default to `root` but could be customized (need to work with @bsunderhus to determine implementation approach).

To facilitate passing props to the actual root element when it's not the "primary" slot, explicitly expose the `root` slot in props (possibly with type constraints to prevent passing problematic things). This would be done in all components for consistency.

In the interest of consistency/clarity, customizing the "primary" slot would be discouraged unless a component falls under certain special categories: definitely input components (`Input`, `Checkbox`, etc), and see "Open Issues" below for discussion of other possibilities.

#### Example: Checkbox

Suppose `Checkbox` sets its `input` slot as "primary." If the user does this:

```tsx
<Checkbox name="foo" checked root={{ id: 'bar' }} ref={ref}>
  sample
</Checkbox>
```

Output HTML is roughly like this (a few things omitted for clarity):

```html
<div id="bar">
  <!-- ref points to this element -->
  <input type="checkbox" name="foo" checked />
  <label>sample</label>
</div>
```

If someone really wanted to, they could still pass props explicitly on the `input` slot rather than top-level. This would give the same output HTML as before:

```tsx
<Checkbox input={{ name: 'foo', checked: true, ref: ref }} root={{ id: 'bar' }}>
  sample
</Checkbox>
```

#### Code updates

TODO: Need to work with @bsunderhus to figure out a non-`mergeProps` version

#### Pros

- Intuitive API for passing props to inputs
- Still allows customization of root props if needed
- Exposing root slot everywhere provides consistency across components
- Still possible to explicitly pass props to the "primary" slot rather than specifying them at top level

#### Cons

- Inconsistent between components, potentially leading to confusion about where native props are applied. This could be somewhat mitigated by having a clear, coherent (and documented!) definition of which components which fall under this special case.
- Potential confusion about whether top-level or slot props take precedence for the primary slot. This could also be addressed by documentation.

#### Open question: should top-level `className` and `style` always be applied to the root?

In a discussion about this topic, it was proposed that since `className` and `style` are commonly used for layout, it would be most intuitive for users if the top-level `className` and `style` are applied to the actual root DOM element (even if top-level native props were applied to a different element).

For example, suppose this Checkbox is in a flex or grid CSS layout where _styling must be applied to the DOM root_, and CSS class `foo` defines this styling.

```tsx
<Checkbox name="foo" checked className="foo">
  sample
</Checkbox>
```

If we go with applying `className` to the root, you'd get roughly this HTML:

```html
<div class="foo">
  <label>sample</label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="foo" checked />
</div>
```

The real question here is, how important is this scenario to users? Is that worth introducing the behavior inconsistency?

### Option B: Use input as `root` and add `wrapper` slot for root DOM element _(formerly discarded option 3)_

Use the native input element as the `root` slot, and use a `wrapper` slot (standardized name) as the actual root DOM element. This is roughly what the component would look like internally:

```tsx
<slots.wrapper>
  <slots.root {...slotProps.root} /> {/* input element */}
  <slots.label {...slotProps.label} />
</slots.wrapper>
```

So doing this would give the desired HTML as shown at the top of the "Discarded Solutions" section:

```tsx
<Checkbox name="foo" checked>
  sample
</Checkbox>
```

And if you wanted to apply props to the wrapper element, you could use slot props:

```tsx
<Checkbox name="foo" checked className="foo" wrapper={{ className: 'bar' }}>
  sample
</Checkbox>
```

Which would give you roughly this:

```html
<div class="bar">
  <input type="checkbox" name="foo" checked className="foo" />
  <label>sample</label>
</div>
```

#### Pros

- For the individual component, more obvious which props go where, and a more intuitive API
- Allows any valid prop to be applied to the root and/or the input (not just one or the other)

#### Cons

- Inconsistent between components, potentially leading to confusion about where native props are applied. This could be somewhat mitigated by having a clear, coherent (and documented!) definition of which components which fall under this special case.
- Inconsistent what `root` means (it's weird to call something "root" which isn't actually at the root). However since `root` is not exposed in the public API in this proposal,
- The name `wrapper` is already being used for slots in some components, with a different meaning (would probably need to change this)

### Option 1: All native props always applied to root (current behavior)

The examples below assume you're rendering a Checkbox and this is roughly your desired HTML output (a few things omitted for clarity):

```html
<div>
  <input type="checkbox" name="foo" checked />
  <label>sample</label>
</div>
```

> **Reason discarded:** Counterintuitive to user; possible incompatibility with 3rd-party form libraries.

Given this:

```tsx
<Checkbox name="foo" checked>
  sample
</Checkbox>
```

You get roughly this HTML, which is not useful:

```html
<!-- checked would be applied here but not used in DOM -->
<div name="foo">
  <input type="checkbox" />
  <label>sample</label>
</div>
```

So to specify a value, you'd have to use slot props:

```tsx
<Checkbox input={{ name: 'foo', checked: true }}>sample</Checkbox>
```

#### Pros

- Complete consistency between all components

#### Cons

- Very counterintuitive API (could help enforce with typings, but still seems unnatural)
- Might not work as easily with 3rd-party form libraries? (needs more research)

### Option 2: Most native props applied to root, selected props applied to "actual" element

> **Reason discarded:** No one could come up with a concrete way to determine which props should be cherry-picked that doesn't rely on intuition (which varies by person)

Given this, and an implementation which uses a list of special props (including `checked` and `name`) that are passed to the "actual" element, you'd get the desired HTML as shown at the top of the "Discarded Solutions" section.

```tsx
<Checkbox name="foo" checked>
  sample
</Checkbox>
```

#### Pros

- Better API for input components (and maybe other special-case components)

#### Cons

- Not clear how to determine which top-level props should be passed down to the `input`
  - If `checked` and `name` (and a few others) go to the `input`, the user might expect this behavior for all props and then be surprised
- Not clear what happens if a prop may be needed in multiple places
  - Example: if top-level `className` or `id` is passed to the `input`, what happens if they also want to give the root a `className` or `id`?
- Inconsistent between components (reduces API clarity)
- It's a breaking change if you want to modify where a prop is applied

### Option 4: Publish an input wrapper for styling, user passes `<input>` as a child

> **Reason discarded:** Counterintuitive API; unclear where user ought to specify certain props

This was proposed [in a PR comment](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/pull/18804#issuecomment-878998437) (see following comments for more discussion).

Provide a wrapper which applies our styling and behaviors, and have the user pass the actual `<input>` as a child. The wrapper would clone the child and apply any behaviors directly to the input. (This is similar to Tooltip or MenuTrigger.)

```tsx
<CheckboxField>
  {/* TBD: where are props specified? does user need to provide `type` prop here? */}
  <input />
</CheckboxField>
```

#### Pros

- An explicit way to specify props on the root and the input

#### Cons

- Extremely counterintuitive API (makes sense for menu triggers but much less sense here)
- Not clear where to specify props that both the wrapper and the input itself would need to access, such as `checked`/`value` and `onChange`. [More details here.](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/pull/18804#issuecomment-880071590). This gets especially messy if/when we need to introduce state management within the control.
