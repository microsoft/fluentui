## Summary

Currently we have no style-guide/functionality requirements on how to be consistent when writing stories for converged components. This RFC should describe (as we progress) the style we want going forward.

## Problem statement

For convergence (vNext) we agreed on a collocated stories approach that uses [Component Story Format (CSF)](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/api/csf) for implementation.

**What are we missing:**

1. what should we use for interactive props playground - controls or knobs?
2. how to use `argTypes`
3. should controls work for all stories or only for general/default one
4. should we render descriptions table in Canvas Control pane
5. how to author e2e suites for those stories
6. how to properly annotate stories with TS metadata to get the best DX possible
7. how structure stories in the storybook nav tree / @miroslavstastny
8. what to do if story files are getting way too big (dissecting big story files into smaller ones) / @ling1726

> **ðŸ’¡ NOTE:**
> This RFC will address the first 4 points for now (should be updated with others later).

## Detailed Design or Proposal

### 1. what should we use for interactive props playground - controls or knobs?

**Proposal:**

We should use [controls](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls).

**Why:**

- while there are some limitations with using controls (they don't mirror the state in URL thus cannot be tested in e2e scenarios), using them is an industry standard in the open source world, also knobs will be deprecated in the next major storybook versions.

### 2. how to use `argTypes`

A pattern that is used in some of the converged stories is to define everything by hand:

```ts
AccordionExample.argTypes = {
  inline: {
    defaultValue: false,
    control: 'boolean',
  },
  navigable: {
    defaultValue: false,
    control: 'boolean',
  },
  circular: {
    defaultValue: false,
    control: 'boolean',
  },
  multiple: {
    defaultValue: false,
    control: 'boolean',
  },
  // ... other definitions of controls
};
```

**Proposal:**

> **NOTE:** we still need to manually provide `argTypes` until all vNext packages including react-components will be migrated to new DX. See [#18514](https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues/18514)

- this is not necessary as storybook generates all those controls automatically from TS metadata (Props interface)
- `argTypes` can be used for use cases when:

  - SB is unable to generated appropriate controls
  - we wanna override default value based on API
  - we wanna hide some controls that don't make sense to be handled in particular story

  ```tsx
  const StoryName = (props: {defaultOpen?:boolean}) => { /* ... */ }
  // HIDE actionable Control
  StoryName.argTypes = {
    defaultOpen: {
      control: false,
    },
  },
  ```

### 3. should controls work for all stories or only for general/default one

**Proposals (2)**

_1. âœ… provide controls with control pane only for default/playground story_

> This is preferred approach - Based on feedback from @teams-prg/@cxe-prg team

With that approach we would probably need to completely get rid of `controls` addon pane from all stories except `Docs` view and our `Default/Playground` story.

This can be achieved by following config:

```js
// @filename .storybook/preview.js

export const parameters = {
  // disable control pane/addon for all stories except `Docs` view
  controls: {
    disable: true,
  },
};
```

```tsx
// @filename FooBar.stories.tsx
export const Playground = (props:FooBarProps) => {.....}
Default.parameters = {
  controls: {
    // Enable Controls Pane only for our default/playground
    disable: false,
  },
};
```

Results in:

- ![Playground story - including controls pane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1223799/121183395-50093e80-c864-11eb-99bd-6e532981fb76.png)
- ![Specific story - no controls pane](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1223799/121184014-f35a5380-c864-11eb-9b2b-046ff4c7b741.png)
- ![Docs view - includes controls for Default/Playground story](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1223799/121184339-4a602880-c865-11eb-842c-f6534f083cda.png)

_2. Make controls work for all stories besides default/playground_

> this would require additional effort from our side (documented below) and we might run into issues when dealing with complex controls although [storybook provides decent amount of customization](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/essentials/controls#fully-custom-args).

<details>
Storybook will generate controls table with API descriptions (Extracted from JSDoc) based on default export per story file.

```tsx
// @filename FooBar.stories.tsx
export default {
  title: 'Components/FooBar',
  component: FooBar,
};
```

By default the controls pane will be used for every story in the story file. This creates confusing DX to the consumer as those controls will generate only a warning message with the inability to use them.

To make the control pane work for every story, we need to provide props argument with proper type so SB generates those stories accordingly. Also they need to be passed to the underlying component.

**Before:**

- Pane generated
- Warnings that controls cannot be generated

```tsx
import {FooBar} from './index'

export const Example = () => {
  return <FooBar onClick={handleClick} value={value}><div>{/* ..... */}</div></Foobar>
}
```

**After:**

- Pane Generated
- No warnings and controls work

```tsx
import {FooBar,FooBarProps} from './index';

export const Example = (props: FooBarProps) => {
 return <FooBar {...props}><div>{/* ..... */}</div></Foobar>
}
```

For more focused stories that showcase more focused behaviors (lets say a controlled version of component), we need to handle this by hand and also turn off controls for props that are being implemented by us.

**Before:**

- Pane Generated
- No warnings but controls don't work (or do but in a weird way)

```tsx
import {FooBar,FooBarProps} from './index';

export const Example = (props: FooBarProps) => {
  const handleClick = () => {};
  const value = 'hello';

  return (
    <FooBar onClick={handleClick} value={value}>
      <div>{/* ..... */}</div>
    </Foobar>
  )
}
```

**After:**

- Pane Generated
- No warnings and controls work
- `value` is not interactive in controls pane as that's handled by our custom logic

```tsx
import {FooBar,FooBarProps} from './index'

export const Example = (props: FooBarProps) => {

  const handleClick = () => {};
  const value = 'hello';

  const resolvedProps = {...props,value,handleClick};

  return <FooBar {...props}><div>{/* ..... */}</div></Foobar>
}

// define all props (except callbacks - those are omitted by default) that are handled by our custom logic
Example.argTypes = {
  // this is needed to remove interactive control from controls pane, otherwise the DX would be confusing (sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't)
  value: {
    control: false,
  },
} as ArgTypes;
```

</details>

### 4. should we render descriptions table in Canvas Control pane

**Proposal**

- we should
- this can be set up in root Storybook config via

```ts
// @filename ./storybook/preview.js
export const parameters = { controls: { expanded: true } };
```

**Before:**

**After:**
