## *Q. Can I contribute to Office UI Fabric React?*

Office UI Fabric React is an open-source distributed project. Lots of developers from inside and outside Microsoft contribute to this project. We highly encourage contributions. There is a core team that works hard to stay on top of the issues and pull requests.

## *Q. Why should I contribute?*

Office UI Fabric React is an open-source distributed project. If you are building a new app inside O365 or Microsoft, this project will potentially save you lots of time, resources and headaches. We encourage all developers who use Fabric React to return a small amount to the community. If you notice bugs, we encourage you to not only open an issue on it but also help fix it. If you have a component that you believe others should use, feel motivated and encouraged to contribute that component back to the community. Sharing is caring. Many developers contribute outside their primary job responsibilities. Additionally, there is plenty to learn. We use a lot of cutting edge best practices used in the industry. Learning those can help you in your career.

## *Q. How do I communicate with a Fabric React core team member?*

We have a very active community both outside and inside Microsoft. Please use the Microsoft [Teams channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a73a5dbc26c9a4d8d91264611995bbdbb%40thread.skype/Fabric%2520Design?groupId=ffe264f2-14d0-48b5-9384-64f808b81294&tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47) for communication from within Microsoft. And a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/OfficeDev/office-ui-fabric-react/issues) from outside Microsoft. We triage these issues at least once a week.

## *Q. How do I contribute to Office UI Fabric React?*

Start by reading our [Contributing](./ghdocs/Contributing/Contributing.md) document. Please point out any missing or incorrect details.

## *Q. Can I become a part of the Fabric core team?*

Yes, you totally can. You will need to help out with reviewing pull requests and triaging and fixing issues. For now, only Microsoft employees can be a part of the core team. We are looking into changing that policy to allow non-Microsoft folks to be a part of the core team.

## *Q. My pull request has been hanging for a long time. What do I do?*

We are very proactive and work hard to keep the outstanding pull request count low. But if your pull request is non-trivial and stuck for a long time, please feel free to tag the pull request that it has been hanging for long and you need help.

## *Q. Where do I read about specific best practices?*

Please refer to the following documents.

[**Contributing fixes and new components**](./ghdocs/Contributing/Contributing.md)

[**Accessibility**](./ghdocs/BestPractices/Accessibility.md)

[**Component Design**](./ghdocs/BestPractices/ComponentDesign.md)

## *Q. When and how does the issue Triage work?*

The Fabric React core team works hard to stay on top of the open issues. We triage issues at least once a week. Due to an increased volume in the number of issues, we have been triaging more often. Once the issue count is under control, we may go back to the once a week rythm.

### Following issues will qualify as high priority

We try to fix high priority bugs ASAP.

* Is this issue blocking the consumer?
* Is this a regression? If yes, how and when did it get in?
* Is this a very serious bug?

Other bugs will qualify as Normal or lower priority and will get fixed as a part of the normal release cadence.

From time to time we do plan to close issues that are very old and have no activity.
